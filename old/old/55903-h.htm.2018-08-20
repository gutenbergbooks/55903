      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he <span
      class="pagenum">1</span><a name="link1" id="link1"></a>work of Dr. Nares
      has filled us with astonishment similar to that which Captain Lemuel
      Gulliver felt when he first landed in Brobdingnag, and saw corn as high as
      the oaks in the New Forest, thimbles as large as buckets, and wrens of the
      bulk of turkeys. The whole book, and every component part of it, is on a
      gigantic scale. The title is as long as an ordinary preface: the prefatory
      matter would furnish out an ordinary book; and the book contains as much
      reading as an ordinary library. We cannot sum up the merits of the
      stupendous mass of paper which lies before us better than by saying that
      it consists of about two thousand closely printed quarto pages, that it
      occupies fifteen hundred inches cubic measure, and
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) <i>Memoirs of The Life and Administration of the Right
     Honourable William Cecil Lord Burghley, Secretary of State in
     the Reign of King Edward the Sixth, and Lord High Treasurer
     of England in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth. Containing an
     Historical Mew of the Times in which he lived, and of the
     many eminent and illustrious Persons with whom he was
     connected; with Extracts from his Private and Official
     Correspondence and other Papers, now first published from the
     Originals</i>. By the Reverend Edward Nares, D. D., Regius
     Professor of Modern History in the University of Oxford. 3
     vols. 4to. London: 1828. 1832.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">2</span><a name="link2" id="link2"></a>that it
      weighs sixty pounds avoirdupois. Such a book might, before the deluge,
      have been considered as light reading by Hilpa and Shalum. But unhappily
      the life of man is now threescore years and ten; and we cannot but think
      it somewhat unfair in Dr. Nares to demand from us so large a portion of so
      short an existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared with the labour of reading through these volumes, all other
      labour, the labour of thieves on the treadmill, of children in factories,
      of negroes in sugar plantations, is an agreeable recreation. There was, it
      is said, a criminal in Italy, who was suffered to make his choice between
      Guicciardini and the galleys. He chose the history. But the war of Pisa
      was too much for him. He changed his mind, and went to the oar.
      Guicciardini, though certainly not the most amusing of writers, is a
      Herodotus or a Froissart, when compared with Dr. Nares. It is not merely
      in bulk, but in specific gravity also, that these memoirs exceed all other
      human compositions. On every subject which the Professor discusses, he
      produces three times as many pages as another man; and one of his pages is
      as tedious as another man&rsquo;s three. His book is swelled to its vast
      dimensions by endless repetitions, by episodes which have nothing to do
      with the main action, by quotations from books which are in every
      circulating library, and by reflections which, when they happen to be
      just, are so obvious that they must necessarily occur to the mind of every
      reader. He employs more words in expounding and defending a truism than
      any other writer would employ in supporting a paradox. Of the rules of
      historical perspective, he has not the faintest notion. There is neither
      foreground nor background in his delineation. The wars of Charles <span
      class="pagenum">3</span><a name="link3" id="link3"></a>the Fifth in
      Germany are detailed at almost as much length as in Robertson&rsquo;s life of
      that prince. The troubles of Scotland are related as fully as in M&rsquo;Crie&rsquo;s
      Life of John Knox. It would be most unjust to deny that Dr. Nares is a man
      of great industry and research; but he is so utterly incompetent to
      arrange the materials which he has collected that he might as well have
      left them in their original repositories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither the facts which Dr. Nares has discovered, nor the arguments which
      he urges, will, we apprehend, materially alter the opinion generally
      entertained by judicious readers of history concerning his hero. Lord
      Burleigh can hardly be called a great man. He was not one of those whose
      genius and energy change the fate of empires. He was by nature and habit
      one of those who follow, not one of those who lead. Nothing that is
      recorded, either of his words or of his actions, indicates intellectual or
      moral elevation. But his talents, though not brilliant, were of an
      eminently useful kind; and his principles, though not inflexible, were not
      more relaxed than those of his associates and competitors. He had a cool
      temper, a sound judgment, great powers of application, and a constant eye
      to the main chance. In his youth, he was, it seems, fond of practical
      jokes. Yet even out of these he contrived to extract some pecuniary
      profit. When he was studying the law at Gray&rsquo;s Inn, he lost all his
      furniture and books at the gaming table to one of his friends. He
      accordingly bored a hole in the wall which separated his chambers from
      those of his associate, and at midnight bellowed through this passage
      threats of damnation and calls to repentance in the ears of the victorious
      gambler, who lay sweating with fear all night, and refunded his winnings
      on his knees next day. &ldquo;Many <span class="pagenum">4</span><a name="link4"
       id="link4"></a>other the like merry jests,&rdquo; says his old biographer, &ldquo;I
      have heard him tell, too long to be here noted.&rdquo; To the last, Burleigh was
      somewhat jocose; and some of his sportive sayings have been recorded by
      Bacon. They show much more shrewdness than generosity, and are, indeed,
      neatly expressed reasons for exacting money rigorously, and for keeping it
      carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must, however, be acknowledged that he was rigorous and careful for the
      public advantage as well as for his own. To extol his moral character as
      Dr. Nares has extolled it is absurd. It would be equally absurd to
      represent him as a corrupt, rapacious, and bad-hearted man. He paid great
      attention to the interests of the state, and great attention also to the
      interest of his own family. He never deserted his friends till it was very
      inconvenient to stand by them, was an excellent Protestant when it was not
      very advantageous to be a Papist, recommended a tolerant policy to his
      mistress as strongly as he could recommend it without hazarding her
      favour, never put to the rack any person from whom it did not seem
      probable that useful information might be derived, and was so moderate in
      his desires that he left only three hundred distinct landed estates,
      though he might, as his honest servant assures us, have left much more,
      &ldquo;if he would have taken money out of the Exchequer for his own use, as
      many Treasurers have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burleigh, like the old Marquess of Winchester, who preceded him in the
      custody of the White Staff, was of the willow, and not of the oak. He
      first rose into notice by defending the supremacy of Henry the Eighth. He
      was subsequently favoured and promoted by the Duke of Somerset. He not
      only contrived to escape unhurt when his patron fell, but became an
      important <span class="pagenum">5</span><a name="link5" id="link5"></a>member
      of the administration of Northumberland. Dr. Nares assures us over and
      over again that there could have been nothing base in Cecil&rsquo;s conduct on
      this occasion; for, says he, Cecil continued to stand well with Cranmer.
      This, we confess, hardly satisfies us. We are much of the mind of
      Falstaff&rsquo;s tailor. We must have better assurance for Sir John than
      Bardolph&rsquo;s. We like not the security.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the whole course of that miserable intrigue which was carried on
      round the dying bed of Edward the Sixth, Cecil so bemeaned himself as to
      avoid, first, the displeasure of Northumberland, and afterwards the
      displeasure of Mary. He was prudently unwilling to put his hand to the
      instrument which changed the course of the succession. But the furious
      Dudley was master of the palace. Cecil, therefore, according to his own
      account, excused himself from signing as a party, but consented to sign as
      a witness. It is not easy to describe his dexterous conduct at this most
      perplexing crisis, in language more appropriate than that which is
      employed by old Fuller. &ldquo;His hand wrote it as secretary of state,&rdquo; says
      that quaint writer; &ldquo;but his heart consented not thereto. Yea, he openly
      opposed it; though at last yielding to the greatness of Northumberland, in
      an age when it was present drowning not to swim with the stream. But as
      the philosopher tells us, that, though the planets be whirled about daily
      from east to west, by the motion of the <i>primum mobile</i>, yet have
      they also a contrary proper motion of their own from west to east, which
      they slowly, though surely, move at their leisure; so Cecil had secret
      counter-endeavours against the strain of the court herein, and privately
      advanced his rightful intentions against the foresaid duke&rsquo;s ambition.&rdquo;
       <span class="pagenum">6</span><a name="link6" id="link6"></a>This was
      undoubtedly the most perilous conjuncture of Cecil&rsquo;s life. Wherever there
      was a safe course, he was safe. But here every course was full of danger.
      His situation rendered it impossible for him to be neutral. If he acted on
      either side, if he refused to act at all, he ran a fearful risk. He saw
      all the difficulties of his position. He sent his money and plate out of
      London, made over his estates to his son, and carried arms about his
      person. His best arms, however, were his sagacity and his self-command.
      The plot in which he had been an unwilling accomplice ended, as it was
      natural that so odious and absurd a plot should end, in the ruin of its
      contrivers. In the mean time, Cecil quietly extricated himself, and,
      having been successively patronized by Henry, by Somerset, and by
      Northumberland, continued to flourish under the protection of Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no aspirations after the crown of martyrdom. He confessed himself,
      therefore, with great decorum, heard mass in Wimbledon Church at Easter,
      and for the better ordering of his spiritual concerns, took a priest into
      his house. Dr. Nares, whose simplicity passes that of any casuist with
      whom we are acquainted, vindicates his hero by assuring us that this was
      not superstition, but pure unmixed hypocrisy. &ldquo;That he did in some manner
      conform, we shall not be able, in the face of existing documents, to deny;
      while we feel in our own minds abundantly satisfied, that, during this
      very trying reign, he never abandoned the prospect of another revolution
      in favour of Protestantism.&rdquo; In another place, the Doctor tells us, that
      Cecil went to mass &ldquo;with no idolatrous intention.&rdquo; Nobody, we believe,
      ever accused him of idolatrous intentions. The very ground of the charge
      against him is that he <span class="pagenum">7</span><a name="link7"
       id="link7"></a>had no idolatrous intentions. We never should have blamed
      him if he had really gone to Wimbledon Church, with the feelings of a good
      Catholic, to worship the host. Dr. Nares speaks in several places with
      just severity of the sophistry of the Jesuits, and with just admiration of
      the incomparable letters of Pascal. It is somewhat strange, therefore,
      that he should adopt, to the full extent, the jesuitical doctrine of the
      direction of intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not blame Cecil for not choosing to be burned. The deep stain upon
      his memory is that, for differences of opinion for which he would risk
      nothing himself, he, in the day of his power, took away without scruple
      the lives of others. One of the excuses suggested in these Memoirs for his
      conforming, during the reign of Mary, to the Church of Rome, is that he
      may have been of the same mind with those German Protestants who were
      called Adiaphorists, and who considered the popish rites as matters
      indifferent. Melancthon was one of these moderate persons, and &ldquo;appears,&rdquo;
       says Dr. Nares, &ldquo;to have gone greater lengths than any imputed to Lord
      Burleigh.&rdquo; We should have thought this not only an excuse, but a complete
      vindication, if Cecil had been an Adiaphorist for the benefit of others as
      well as for his own. If the popish rites were matters of so little moment
      that a good Protestant might lawfully practise them for his safety, how
      could it be just or humane that a Papist should be hanged, drawn, and
      quartered, for practising them from a sense of duty? Unhappily these
      non-essentials soon became matters of life and death. Just at the very
      time at which Cecil attained the highest point of power and favour, an Act
      of Parliament was passed by which the penalties of high treason were
      denounced <span class="pagenum">8</span><a name="link8" id="link8"></a>against
      persons who should do in sincerity what he had done from cowardice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the reign of Mary, Cecil was employed in a mission scarcely
      consistent with the character of a zealous Protestant. He was sent to
      escort the Papal Legate, Cardinal Pole, from Brussels to London. That
      great body of moderate persons who cared more for the quiet of the realm
      than for the controverted points which were in issue between the Churches
      seem to have placed their chief hope in the wisdom and humanity of the
      gentle Cardinal. Cecil, it is clear, cultivated the friendship of Pole
      with great assiduity, and received great advantage from the Legate&rsquo;s
      protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the best protection of Cecil, during the gloomy and disastrous reign
      of Mary, was that which he derived from his own prudence and from his own
      temper, a prudence which could never be lulled into carelessness, a temper
      which could never be irritated into rashness The Papists could find no
      occasion against him. Yet he did not lose the esteem even of those sterner
      Protestants who had preferred exile to recantation. He attached himself to
      the persecuted heiress of the throne, and entitled himself to her
      gratitude and confidence. Yet he continued to receive marks of favour from
      the Queen. In the House of Commons, he put himself at the head of the
      party opposed to the Court. Yet, so guarded was his language that, even
      when some of those who acted with him were imprisoned by the Privy
      Council, he escaped with impunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Mary died: Elizabeth succeeded; and Cecil rose at once to
      greatness. He was sworn in Privy-councillor and Secretary of State to the
      new sovereign before he left her prison of Hatfield; and he continued to
      serve her during forty years, without <span class="pagenum">9</span><a
      name="link9" id="link9"></a>intermission, in the highest employments. His
      abilities were precisely those which keep men long in power. He belonged
      to the class of the Walpoles, the Pelhams, and the Liverpools, not to that
      of the St. Johns, the Carterets, the Chathams, and the Cannings. If he had
      been a man of original genius and of an enterprising spirit, it would have
      been scarcely possible for him to keep his power or even his head. There
      was not room in one government for an Elizabeth and a Richelieu. What the
      haughty daughter of Henry needed, was a moderate, cautions, flexible
      minister, skilled in the details of business, competent to advise, but not
      aspiring to command. And such a minister she found in Burleigh. No arts
      could shake the confidence which she reposed in her old and trusty
      servant. The courtly graces of Leicester, the brilliant talents and
      accomplishments of Essex, touched the fancy, perhaps the heart, of the
      woman; but no rival could deprive the Treasurer of the place which he
      possessed in the favour of the Queen. She sometimes chid him sharply; but
      he was the man whom she delighted to honour. For Burleigh, she forgot her
      usual parsimony both of wealth and of dignities. For Burleigh, she relaxed
      that severe etiquette to which she was unreasonably attached. Every other
      person to whom she addressed her speech, or on whom the glance of her
      eagle eye fell, instantly sank on his knee. For Burleigh alone, a chair
      was set in her presence; and there the old minister, by birth only a plain
      Lincolnshire esquire, took his ease, while the haughty heirs of the
      Fitzalans and the De Veres humbled themselves to the dust around him. At
      length, having survived all his early coadjutors, and rivals, he died full
      of years and honours. His royal mistress visited him on his <span
      class="pagenum">10</span><a name="link10" id="link10"></a>death-bed, and
      cheered him with assurances of her affection and esteem; and his power
      passed, with little diminution, to a son who inherited his abilities, and
      whose mind had been formed by his counsels.

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The life of Burleigh was commensurate with one of the most important
      periods in the history of the world. It exactly measures the time during
      which the House of Austria held decided superiority and aspired to
      universal dominion. In the year in which Burleigh was born, Charles the
      Fifth obtained the imperial crown. In the year in which Burleigh died, the
      vast designs which had, during near a century, kept Europe in constant
      agitation, were buried in the same grave with the proud and sullen Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The life of Burleigh was commensurate also with the period during which a
      great moral revolution was effected, a revolution the consequences of
      which were felt, not only in the cabinets of princes, but at half the
      firesides in Christendom. He was born when the great religious schism was
      just commencing. He lived to see that schism complete, and to see a line
      of demarcation, which, since his death, has been very little altered,
      strongly drawn between Protestant and Catholic Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only event of modern times which can be properly compared with the
      Reformation is the French Revolution, or, to speak more accurately, that
      great revolution of political feeling which took place in almost every
      part of the civilised world during the eighteenth century, and which
      obtained in France its most terrible and signal triumph. Each of these
      memorable events may be described as a rising up of the human reason
      against a Caste. The one was a <span class="pagenum">11</span><a
      name="link11" id="link11"></a>straggle of the laity against the clergy for
      intellectual liberty; the other was a straggle of the people against
      princes and nobles for political liberty. In both cases, the spirit of
      innovation was at first encouraged by the class to which it was likely to
      be most prejudicial. It was under the patronage of Frederic, of Catherine,
      of Joseph, and of the grandees of France, that the philosophy which
      afterwards threatened all the thrones and aristocracies of Europe with
      destruction first became formidable. The ardour with which men betook
      themselves to liberal studies, at the close of the fifteenth and the
      beginning of the sixteenth century, was zealously encouraged by the heads
      of that very church to which liberal studies were destined to be fatal. In
      both cases, when the explosion came, it came with a violence which
      appalled and disgusted many of those who had previously been distinguished
      by the freedom of their opinions. The violence of the democratic party in
      France made Burke a Tory and Alfieri a courtier. The violence of the
      chiefs of the German schism made Erasmus a defender of abuses, and turned
      the author of Utopia into a persecutor. In both cases, the convulsion
      which had overthrown deeply seated errors, shook all the principles on
      which society rests to their very foundations. The minds of men were
      unsettled. It seemed for a time that all order and morality were about to
      perish with the prejudices with which they had been long and intimately
      associated. Frightful cruelties were committed. Immense masses of property
      were confiscated. Every part of Europe swarmed with exiles. In moody and
      turbulent spirits zeal soured into malignity, or foamed into madness. From
      the political agitation of the eighteenth century sprang the Jacobins.
      <span class="pagenum">12</span><a name="link12" id="link12"></a>From the
      religious agitation of the sixteenth century sprang the Anabaptists. The
      partisans of Robespierre robbed and murdered in the name of fraternity and
      equality. The followers of Kniperdoling robbed and murdered in the name of
      Christian liberty. The feeling of patriotism was, in many parts of Europe,
      almost wholly extinguished. All the old maxims of foreign policy were
      changed. Physical boundaries were superseded by moral boundaries. Nations
      made war on each other with new arms, with arms which no fortifications,
      however strong by nature or by art, could resist, with arms before which
      rivers parted like the Jordan, and ramparts fell down like the walls of
      Jericho. The great masters of fleets and armies were often reduced to
      confess, like Milton&rsquo;s warlike angel, how hard they found it <br /><br /><span

      substance with corporeal bar.&rdquo; </span></span>

      Europe was divided, as Greece had been divided during the period
      concerning which Thucydides wrote. The conflict was not, as it is in
      ordinary times, between state and state, but between two omnipresent
      factions, each of which was in some places dominant and in other places
      oppressed, but which, openly or covertly, carried on their strife in the
      bosom of every society. No man asked whether another belonged to the same
      country with himself, but whether he belonged to the same sect.
      Party-spirit seemed to justify and consecrate acts which, in any other
      times, would have been considered as the foulest of treasons. The French
      emigrant saw nothing disgraceful in bringing Austrian and Prussian hussars
      to Paris. The Irish or Italian democrat saw no impropriety in serving the
      French Directory against his own native government. <span class="pagenum">13</span><a
      name="link13" id="link13"></a>So, in the sixteenth century, the fury of
      theological factions suspended all national animosities and jealousies.
      The Spaniards were invited into France by the League; the English were
      invited into France by the Huguenots.

      We by no means intend to underrate or to palliate the crimes and excesses
      which, during the last generation, were produced by the spirit of
      democracy. But, when we hear men zealous for the Protestant religion,
      constantly represent the French Revolution as radically and essentially
      evil on account of those crimes and excesses, we cannot but remember that
      the deliverance of our ancestors from the house of their spiritual bondage
      was effected &ldquo;by plagues and by signs, by wonders and by war.&rdquo; We cannot
      but remember that, as in the case of the French Revolution, so also in the
      case of the Reformation, those who rose up against tyranny were themselves
      deeply tainted with the vices which tyranny engenders. We cannot but
      remember that libels scarcely less scandalous than those of Hebert,
      mummeries scarcely less absurd than those of Clootz, and crimes scarcely
      less atrocious than those of Marat, disgrace the early history of
      Protestantism. The Reformation is an event long passed. That volcano has
      spent its rage. The wide waste produced by its outbreak is forgotten. The
      landmarks which were swept away have been replaced. The ruined edifices
      have been repaired. The lava has covered with a rich incrustation the
      fields which it once devastated, and, after having turned a beautiful and
      fruitful garden into a desert, has again turned the desert into a still
      more beautiful and fruitful garden. The second great irruption is not yet
      over. The marks of its ravages are still all around us. The ashes are
      still hot beneath <span class="pagenum">14</span><a name="link14"
       id="link14"></a>our feet. In some directions the deluge of fire still
      continues to spread. Yet experience surely entitles us to believe, that
      this explosion, like that which preceded it, will fertilize the soil which
      it has devastated. Already, in those parts which have suffered most
      severely, rich cultivation and secure dwellings have begun to appear
      amidst the waste. The more we read of the history of past ages, the more
      we observe the signs of our own times, the more do we feel our hearts
      filled and swelled up by a good hope for the future destinies of the human
      race.

    <p>
      The history of the Reformation in England is full of strange problems. The
      most prominent and extraordinary phenomenon which it presents to us is the
      gigantic strength of the government contrasted with the feebleness of the
      religious parties. During the twelve or thirteen years which followed the
      death of Henry the Eighth, the religion of the state was thrice changed.
      Protestantism was established by Edward; the Catholic Church was restored
      by Mary; Protestantism was again established by Elizabeth. The faith of
      the nation seemed to depend on the personal inclinations of the sovereign.
      Nor was this all. An established church was then, as a matter of course, a
      persecuting church. Edward persecuted Catholics. Mary persecuted
      Protestants. Elizabeth persecuted Catholics again. The father of those
      three sovereigns had enjoyed the pleasure of persecuting both sects at
      once, and had sent to death, on the same hurdle, the heretic who denied
      the real presence, and the traitor who denied the royal supremacy. There
      was nothing in England like that fierce and bloody opposition which, in
      France, each of the religious factions in its turn offered to the
      government. We had neither a <span class="pagenum">15</span><a
      name="link15" id="link15"></a>Coligny nor a Mayenne, neither a Moncontour
      nor an Ivry. No English city braved sword and famine for the reformed
      doctrines with the spirit of Rochelle, or for the Catholic doctrines with
      the spirit of Paris. Neither sect in England formed a League. Neither sect
      extorted a recantation from the sovereign. Neither sect could obtain from
      an adverse sovereign even a toleration. The English Protestants, after
      several years of domination, sank down with scarcely a straggle under the
      tyranny of Mary. The Catholics, after having regained and abused their old
      ascendency, submitted patiently to the severe rule of Elizabeth. Neither
      Protestants nor Catholics engaged in any great and well organized scheme
      of resistance. A few wild and tumultuous risings, suppressed as soon as
      they appeared, a few dark conspiracies in which only a small number of
      desperate men engaged, such were the utmost efforts made by these two
      parties to assert the most sacred of human rights, attacked by the most
      odious tyranny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The explanation of these circumstances which has generally been given is
      very simple, but by no means satisfactory. The power of the crown, it is
      said, was then at its height, and was in fact despotic. This solution, we
      own, seems to us to be no solution at all. It has long been the fashion, a
      fashion introduced by Mr. Hume, to describe the English monarchy in the
      sixteenth century as an absolute monarchy. And such undoubtedly it appears
      to a superficial observer. Elizabeth, it is true, often spoke to her
      parliaments in language as haughty and imperious as that which the Great
      Turk would use to his divan. She punished with great severity members of
      the House of Commons who, in her opinion, carried the freedom of debate
      too far. <span class="pagenum">16</span><a name="link16" id="link16"></a>She
      assumed the power of legislating by means of proclamations. She imprisoned
      her subjects without bringing them to a legal trial. Torture was often
      employed, in defiance, of the laws of England, for the purpose of
      extorting confessions from those who were shut up in her dungeons. The
      authority of the Star-Chamber and of the Ecclesiastical Commission was at
      its highest point. Severe restraints were imposed on political and
      religious discussion. The number of presses was at one time limited. No
      man could print without a license; and every work had to undergo the
      scrutiny of the Primate, or the Bishop of London. Persons whose writings
      were displeasing to the court were cruelly mutilated, like Stubbs, or put
      to death, like Penry. Nonconformity was severely punished. The Queen
      prescribed the exact rule of religious faith and discipline; and whoever
      departed from that rule, either to the right or to the left, was in danger
      of severe penalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was this government. Yet we know that it was loved by the great body
      of those who lived under it. We know that, during the fierce contests of
      the sixteenth century, both the hostile parties spoke of the time of
      Elizabeth as of a golden age. That great Queen has now been lying two
      hundred and thirty years in Henry the Seventh&rsquo;s chapel. Yet her memory is
      still dear to the hearts of a free people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth seems to be that the government of the Tudors was, with a few
      occasional deviations, a popular government, under the forms of despotism.
      At first sight, it may seem that the prerogatives of Elizabeth were not
      less ample than those of Lewis the Fourteenth, and her parliaments were as
      obsequious as his parliaments, that her warrant had as much authority as
      <span class="pagenum">17</span><a name="link17" id="link17"></a>his <i>lettre-de-cachet</i>.
      The extravagance with which her courtiers eulogized her personal and
      mental charms went beyond the adulation of Boileau and Moliere. Lewis
      would have blushed to receive from those who composed the gorgeous circles
      of Marli and Versailles such outward marks of servitude as the haughty
      Britoness exacted of all who approached her. But the authority of Lewis
      rested on the support of his army. The authority of Elizabeth rested
      solely on the support of her people. Those who say that her power was
      absolute do not sufficiently consider in what her power consisted. Her
      power consisted in the willing obedience of her subjects, in their
      attachment to her person and to her office, in their respect for the old
      line from which she sprang, in their sense of the general security which
      they enjoyed under her government. These were the means, and the only
      means, which she had at her command for carrying her decrees into
      execution, for resisting foreign enemies, and for crushing domestic
      treason. There was not a ward in the city, there was not a hundred in any
      shire in England, which could not have overpowered the handful of armed
      men who composed her household. If a hostile sovereign threatened
      invasion, if an ambitious noble raised the standard of revolt, she could
      have recourse only to the trainbands of her capital and the array of her
      counties, to the citizens and yeomen of England, commanded by the
      merchants and esquires of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, when intelligence arrived of the vast preparations which Philip was
      making for the subjugation of the realm, the first person to whom the
      government thought of applying for assistance was the Lord Mayor of
      London. They sent to ask him what force the city would engage to furnish
      for the defence of the kingdom <span class="pagenum">18</span><a
      name="link18" id="link18"></a>against the Spaniards. The Mayor and Common
      Council, in return, desired to know what force the Queen&rsquo;s Highness wished
      them to furnish. The answer was, fifteen ships and five thousand men. The
      Londoners deliberated on the matter, and, two days after, &ldquo;humbly
      entreated the council, in sign of their perfect love and loyalty to prince
      and country, to accept ten thousand men, and thirty ships amply
      furnished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      People who could give such signs as these of their loyalty were by no
      means to be misgoverned with impunity. The English in the sixteenth
      century were, beyond all doubt, a free people. They had not, indeed, the
      outward show of freedom; but they had the reality. They had not as good a
      constitution as we have; but thev had that without which the best
      constitution is as useless as the king&rsquo;s proclamation against vice and
      immorality, that which, without any constitution, keeps rulers in awe,
      force, and the spirit to use it. Parliaments, it is true, were rarely
      held, and were not very respectfully treated. The great charter was often
      violated. But the people had a security against gross and systematic
      misgovernment, far stronger than all the parchment that was ever marked
      with the sign manual, and than all the wax that was ever pressed by the
      great seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a common error in politics to confound means with ends.
      Constitutions, charters, petitions of right, declarations of right,
      representative assemblies, electoral colleges, are not good governments;
      nor do they, even when most elaborately constructed, necessarily produce
      good government. Laws exist in vain for those who have not the courage and
      the means to defend them. Electors meet in vain where want makes them the
      <span class="pagenum">19</span><a name="link19" id="link19"></a>slaves of
      the landlord, or where superstition makes them the slaves of the priest.
      Representative assemblies sit in vain unless they have at their command,
      in the last resort, the physical power which is necessary to make their
      deliberations free, and their votes effectual.

      The Irish are better represented in parliament than the Scotch, who indeed
      are not represented at all. (1) But are the Irish better governed than the
      Scotch? Surely not. This circumstance has of late been used as an argument
      against reform. It proves nothing against reform. It proves only this,
      that laws have no magical, no supernatural virtue; that laws do not act
      like Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp or Prince Ahmed&rsquo;s apple; that priestcraft, that
      ignorance, that the rage of contending factions, may make good
      institutions useless; that intelligence, sobriety, industry, moral
      freedom, firm union, may supply in a great measure the defects of the
      worst representative system. A people whose education and habits are such,
      that, in every quarter of the world, they rise above the mass of those
      with whom they mix, as surely as oil rises to the top of water, a people
      of such temper and self-government that the wildest popular excesses
      recorded in their history partake of the gravity of judicial proceedings,
      and of the solemnity of religious rites, a people whose national pride and
      mutual attachment have passed into a proverb, a people whose high and
      fierce spirit, so forcibly described in the haughty motto which encircles
      their thistle, preserved their independence, during a straggle of
      centuries, from the encroachments of wealthier and more powerful
      neighbours, such a people cannot be

      oppressed. Any government, however constituted, must respect their wishes
      and tremble at their discontents. It is indeed most desirable that such a
      people should exercise a direct influence on the conduct of affairs, and
      should make their wishes known through constitutional organs. But some
      influence, direct or indirect, they will assuredly possess. Some organ,
      constitutional or unconstitutional, they will assuredly find. They will be
      better governed under a good constitution than under a bad constitution.
      But they will be better governed under the worst constitution than some
      other nations under the best. In any general classification of
      constitutions, the constitution of Scotland must be reckoned as one of the
      worst, perhaps as the worst, in Christian Europe. Yet the Scotch are not
      ill governed, and the reason is simply that they will not bear to be ill
      governed.

      In some of the oriental monarchies, in Afghanistan for example, though
      there exists nothing which an European publicist would call a
      Constitution, the sovereign generally governs in conformity with certain
      rules established for the public benefit; and the sanction of those rules
      is, that every Afghan approves them, and that every Afghan is a soldier.

      The monarchy of England in the sixteenth century was a monarchy of this
      kind. It is called an absolute monarchy, because little respect was paid
      by the Tudors to those institutions which we have been accustomed to
      consider as the sole checks on the power of the sovereign. A modern
      Englishman can hardly understand how the people can have had any real
      security for good government under kings who levied benevolences, and chid
      the House of Commons as they would have chid a pack of dogs. People do not
      sufficiently <span class="pagenum">21</span><a name="link21" id="link21"></a>consider
      that, though the legal checks were feeble, the natural checks were strong.
      There was one great and effectual limitation on the royal authority, the
      knowledge that, if the patience of the nation were severely tried, the
      nation would put forth its strength, and that its strength would be found
      irresistible. If a large body of Englishmen became thoroughly
      discontented, instead of presenting requisitions, holding large meetings,
      passing resolutions, signing petitions, forming associations and unions,
      they rose up; they took their halberds and their bows; and, if the
      sovereign was not sufficiently popular to find among his subjects other
      halberds and other bows to oppose to the rebels, nothing remained for him
      but a repetition of the horrible scenes of Berkeley and Pomfret. He had no
      regular army which could, by its superior arms and its superior skill,
      overawe or vanquish the sturdy Commons of his realm, abounding in the
      native hardihood of Englishmen, and trained in the simple discipline of
      the militia.

      It has been said that the Tudors were as absolute as the Cæsars. Never was
      parallel so unfortunate. The government of the Tudors was the direct
      opposite to the government of Augustus and his successors. The Cæsars
      ruled despotically, by means of a great standing army, under the decent
      forms of a republican constitution. They called themselves citizens. They
      mixed unceremoniously with other citizens. In theory they were only the
      elective magistrates of a free commonwealth. Instead of arrogating to
      themselves despotic power, they acknowledged allegiance to the senate.
      They were merely the lieutenants of that venerable body. They mixed in
      debate. They even appeared as advocates before the courts of law. Yet they
      could safely indulge in the wildest freaks of <span class="pagenum">22</span><a
      name="link22" id="link22"></a>cruelty and rapacity, while their legions
      remained faithful. Our Tudors, on the other hand, under the titles and
      forms of monarchical supremacy, were essentially popular magistrates. They
      had no means of protecting themselves against the public hatred; and they
      were therefore compelled to court the public favour. To enjoy all the
      state and all the personal indulgences of absolute power, to be adored
      with Oriental prostrations, to dispose at will of the liberty and even of
      the life of ministers and courtiers, this the nation granted to the
      Tudors. But the condition on which they were suffered to be the tyrants of
      Whitehall was that they should be the mild and paternal sovereigns of
      England. They were under the same restraints with regard to their people
      under which a military despot is placed with regard to his army. They
      would have found it as dangerous to grind their subjects with cruel
      taxation as Nero would have found it to leave his prætorians unpaid. Those
      who immediately surrounded the royal person, and engaged in the hazardous
      game of ambition, were exposed to the most fearful dangers. Buckingham,
      Cromwell, Surrey, Seymour of Sudeley, Somerset, Northumberland, Suffolk,
      Norfolk, Essex, perished on the scaffold. But in general the country
      gentleman hunted and the merchant traded in peace. Even Henry, as cruel as
      Domitian, but far more politic, contrived, while reeking; with the blood
      of the Lamiæ, to be a favourite with the cobblers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tudors committed very tyrannical acts. But in their ordinary dealings
      with the people they were not, and could not safely be, tyrants. Some
      excesses were easily pardoned. For the nation was proud of the high and
      fiery blood of its magnificent princes, and <span class="pagenum">23</span><a
      name="link23" id="link23"></a>saw, in many proceedings which a lawyer
      would even then have condemned, the outbreak of the same noble spirit
      which so manfully hurled foul scorn at Parma and at Spain. But to this
      endurance there was a limit. If the government ventured to adopt measures
      which the people really felt to be oppressive, it was soon compelled to
      change its course. When Henry the Eighth attempted to raise a forced loan
      of unusual amount by proceedings of unusual rigour, the opposition which
      he encountered was such as appalled even his stubborn and imperious
      spirit. The people, we are told, said that, if they were treated thus,
      &ldquo;then were it worse than the taxes of France; and England should be bond,
      and not free.&rdquo; The county of Suffolk rose in arms. The king prudently
      yielded to an opposition which, if he had persisted, would, in all
      probability, have taken the form of a general rebellion. Towards the close
      of the reign of Elizabeth, the people felt themselves aggrieved by the
      monopolies. The Queen, proud and courageous as she was, shrank from a
      contest with the nation, and, with admirable sagacity, conceded all that
      her subjects had demanded, while it was yet in her power to concede&rsquo; with
      dignity and grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be imagined that a people who had in their own hands the means
      of checking their princes would suffer any prince to impose upon them a
      religion generally detested. It is absurd to suppose that, if the nation
      had been decidedly attached to the Protestant faith, Mary could have
      reestablished the Papal supremacy. It is equally absurd to suppose that,
      if the nation had been zealous for the ancient religion, Elizabeth could
      have restored the Protestant Church. The truth is, that the people were
      not disposed to engage in <span class="pagenum">24</span><a name="link24"
       id="link24"></a>a struggle either for the new or for the old doctrines.
      Abundance of spirit was shown when it seemed likely that Mary would resume
      her father&rsquo;s grants of church property, or that she would sacrifice the
      interests of England to the husband whom she regarded with unmerited
      tenderness. That queen found that it would be madness to attempt the
      restoration of the abbey lands. She found that her subjects would never
      suffer her to make her hereditary kingdom a fief of Castile. On these
      points she encountered a steady resistance, and was compelled to give way.
      If she was able to establish the Catholic worship and to persecute those
      who would not conform to it, it was evidently because the people cared far
      less for the Protestant religion than for the rights of property and for
      the independence of the English crown. In plain words, they did not think
      the difference between the hostile sects worth a struggle. There was
      undoubtedly a zealous Protestant party and a zealous Catholic party. But
      both these parties were, we believe, very small. We doubt, whether both
      together made up, at the time of Mary&rsquo;s death, the twentieth part of the
      nation. The remaining nineteen twentieths halted between the two opinions,
      and were not disposed to risk a revolution in the government, for the
      purpose of giving to either of the extreme factions an advantage over the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      We possess no data which will enable us to compare with exactness the
      force of the two sects. Mr. Butler asserts that, even at the accession of
      James the First, a majority of the population of England were Catholics.
      This is pure assertion; and is not only unsupported by evidence, but, we
      think, completely disproved by the strongest evidence. Dr. Lingard is of
      opinion that the Catholics were one half of the nation in the middle of
      <span class="pagenum">25</span><a name="link25" id="link25"></a>the reign
      of Elizabeth. Rushton says that, when Elizabeth came to the throne, the
      Catholics were two thirds of the nation, and the Protestants only one
      third. The most judicious and impartial of English historians, Mr. Hallam,
      is, on the contrary, of opinion, that two thirds were Protestants, and
      only one third Catholics. To us, we must confess, it seems incredible
      that, if the Protestants were really two to one, they should have borne
      the government of Mary, or that, if the Catholics were really two to one,
      they should have borne the government of Elizabeth. We are at a loss to
      conceive how a sovereign who has no standing army, and whose power rests
      solely on the loyalty of his subjects, can continue for years to persecute
      a religion to which the majority of his subjects are sincerely attached.
      In fact, the Protestants did rise up against one sister, and the Catholics
      against the other. Those risings clearly showed how small and feeble both
      the parties were. Both in the one case and in the other the nation ranged
      itself on the side of the government, and the insurgents were speedily put
      down and punished. The Kentish gentlemen who took up arms for the reformed
      doctrines against Mary, and the great Northern Earls who displayed the
      banner of the Five Wounds against Elizabeth, were alike considered by the
      great body of their countrymen as wicked disturbers of the public peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The account which Cardinal Bentivoglio gave of the state of religion in
      England well deserves consideration. The zealous Catholics he reckoned at
      one thirtieth part of the nation. The people who would without the least
      scruple become Catholics, if the Catholic religion were established, he
      estimated at four fifths of the nation. We believe this account to have
      been very near the truth. We believe that the people, <span class="pagenum">26</span><a
      name="link26" id="link26"></a>whose minds were made up on either side, who
      were inclined to make any sacrifice or run any risk for either religion,
      were very few. Each side had a few enterprising champions, and a few
      stout-hearted martyrs; but the nation, undetermined in its opinions and
      feelings, resigned itself implicitly to the guidance of the government,
      and lent to the sovereign for the time being an equally ready aid against
      either of the extreme parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are very far from saying that the English of that generation were
      irreligious. They held firmly those doctrines which are common to the
      Catholic and to the Protestant theology. But they had no fixed opinion as
      to the matters in dispute between the churches. They were in a situation
      resembling that of those Borderers whom Sir Walter Scott has described
      with so much spirit, <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"Who sought the
      beeves that made their broth, <br /><span class="indent20">In England and
      in Scotland both.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And who <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"Nine times outlawed had been
      <br /><span class="indent20">By England&rsquo;s king and Scotland&rsquo;s queen.&rdquo;
       </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They were sometimes Protestants, sometimes Catholics; sometimes half
      Protestants half Catholics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English had not, for ages, been bigoted Papists. In the fourteenth
      century, the first and perhaps the greatest of the reformers, John
      Wickliffe, had stirred the public mind to its inmost depths. During the
      same century, a scandalous schism in the Catholic Church had diminished,
      in many parts of Europe, the reverence in which the Roman pontiffs were
      held. It is clear that, a hundred years before the time of Luther, a great
      party in this kingdom was eager for a change at least as extensive as that
      which was subsequently <span class="pagenum">27</span><a name="link27"
       id="link27"></a>effected by Henry the Eighth. The House of Commons, in the
      reign of Henry the Fourth, proposed a confiscation of ecclesiastical
      property, more sweeping and violent even than that which took place under
      the administration of Thomas Cromwell; and, though defeated in this
      attempt, they succeeded in depriving the clerical order of some of its
      most oppressive privileges. The splendid conquests of Henry the Fifth
      turned the attention of the nation from domestic reform. The Council of
      Constance removed some of the grossest of those scandals which had
      deprived the Church of the public respect. The authority of that venerable
      synod propped up the sinking authority of the Popedom. A considerable
      reaction took place. It cannot, however, be doubted, that there was still
      some concealed Lollardism in England; or that many who did not absolutely
      dissent from any doctrine held by the Church of Rome were jealous of the
      wealth and power enjoyed by her ministers. At the very beginning of the
      reign of Henry the Eighth, a struggle took place between the clergy and
      the courts of law, in which the courts of law remained victorious. One of
      the bishops, on that occasion, declared that the common people entertained
      the strongest prejudices against his order, and that a clergyman had no
      chance of fair play before a lay tribunal. The London juries, he said,
      entertained such a spite to the Church that, if Abel were a priest, they
      would find him guilty of the murder of Cain. This was said a few months
      before the time when Martin Luther began to preach at Wittenburg against
      indulgences.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Reformation did not find the English bigoted Papists, so neither
      was it conducted in such a manner as to make them zealous Protestants. It
      was not under <span class="pagenum">28</span><a name="link28" id="link28"></a>the
      direction of men like that fiery Saxon who swore that he would go to
      Worms, though he had to face as many devils as there were tiles on the
      houses, or like that brave Switzer who was struck down while praying in
      front of the ranks of Zurich. No preacher of religion had the same power
      here which Calvin had at Geneva and Knox in Scotland. The government put
      itself early at the head of the movement, and thus acquired power to
      regulate, and occasionally to arrest, the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      To many persons it appears extraordinary that Henry the Eighth should have
      been able to maintain himself so long in an intermediate position between
      the Catholic and Protestant parties. Most extraordinary it would indeed
      be, if we were to suppose that the nation consisted of none but decided
      Catholics and decided Protestants. The fact is that the great mass of the
      people was neither Catholic nor Protestant, but was, like its sovereign,
      midway between the two sects. Henry, in that very part of his conduct
      which has been represented as most capricious and inconsistent, was
      probably following a policy far more pleasing to the majority of his
      subjects than a policy like that of Edward, or a policy like that of Mary,
      would have been. Down even to the very close of the reign of Elizabeth,
      the people were in a state somewhat resembling that in which, as
      Machiavelli says, the inhabitants of the Roman empire were, during the
      transition from heathenism to Christianity; &ldquo;sendo la maggior parte di
      loro incerti a quale Dio dovessero ricorrere.&rdquo; They were generally, we
      think, favourable to the royal supremacy. They disliked the policy of the
      Court of Rome. Their spirit rose against the interference of a foreign
      priest with their national concerns. The bull <span class="pagenum">29</span><a
      name="link29" id="link29"></a>which pronounced sentence of deposition
      against Elizabeth, the plots which were formed against her life, the
      usurpation of her titles by the Queen of Scotland, the hostility of
      Philip, excited their strongest indignation. The cruelties of Bonner were
      remembered with disgust. Some parts of the new system, the use of the
      English language, for example, in public worship, and the communion in
      both kinds, were undoubtedly popular. On the other hand, the early lessons
      of the nurse and the priest were not forgotten. The ancient ceremonies
      were long remembered with affectionate reverence. A large portion of the
      ancient theology lingered to the last in the minds which had been imbued
      with it in childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best proof that the religion of the people was of this mixed kind is
      furnished by the Drama of that age. No man would bring unpopular opinions
      prominently forward in a play intended for representation. And we may
      safely conclude, that feelings and opinions which pervade the whole
      Dramatic Literature of a generation, are feelings and opinions of which
      the men of that generation generally partook.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest and most popular dramatists of the Elizabethan age treat
      religious subjects in a very remarkable manner. They speak respectfully of
      the fundamental doctrines of Christianity. But they speak neither like
      Catholics nor like Protestants, but like persons who are wavering between
      the two systems, or who have made a system for themselves out of parts
      selected from both. They seem to hold some of the Romish rites and
      doctrines in high respect. They treat the vow of celibacy, for example, so
      tempting, and, in later times, so common a subject for ribaldry, with
      mysterious reverence. Almost every member of a religious order <span
      class="pagenum">30</span><a name="link30" id="link30"></a>whom they
      introduce is a holy and venerable man. We remember in their plays nothing
      resembling the coarse ridicule with which the Catholic religion and its
      ministers were assailed, two generations later, by dramatists, who wished
      to please the multitude. We remember no Friar Dominic, no Father Foigard,
      among the characters drawn by those great poets. The scene at the close of
      the Knight of Malta might have been written by a fervent Catholic.
      Massinger show&rsquo;s a great fondness for ecclesiastics of the Romish Church,
      and has even gone so far as to bring a virtuous and interesting Jesuit on
      the stage. Ford, in that fine play which it is painful to read and
      scarcely decent to name, assigns a highly creditable part to the Friar.
      The partiality of Shakspeare for Friars is well known. In Hamlet, the
      Ghost complains that he died without extreme unction, and, in defiance of
      the article which condemns the doctrine of purgatory, declares that he is
      <br /><br /><span class="indent30">"Confined to fast in fires, <br /><span
      class="indent20">Till the foul crimes, done in his days of nature, <br /><span
      class="indent20">Are burnt and purged away.&rdquo; </span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      These lines, we suspect, would have raised a tremendous storm in the
      theatre at any time during the reign of Charles the Second. They were
      clearly not written by a zealous Protestant, or for zealous Protestants.
      Yet the author of King John and Henry the Eighth was surely no friend to
      papal supremacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, we think, only one solution of the phenomena which we find in
      the history and in the drama of that age. The religion of the English was
      a mixed religion, like that of the Samaritan settlers, described in the
      second book of Kings, who &ldquo;feared the Lord, and served their graven
      images;&rdquo; like that of the Judaizing Christians who blended the ceremonies
      and <span class="pagenum">31</span><a name="link31" id="link31"></a>doctrines
      of the synagogue with those of the church; like that of the Mexican
      Indians, who, during many generations after the subjugation of their race,
      continued to unite with the rites learned from their conquerors the
      worship of the grotesque idols which had been adored by Montezuma and
      Guatemozin.
    </p>
    <p>
      These feelings were not confined to the populace. Elizabeth herself was by
      no means exempt from them. A crucifix, with wax-lights burning round it,
      stood in her private chapel. She always spoke with disgust and anger of
      the marriage of priests. &ldquo;I was in horror,&rdquo; says Archbishop Parker, &ldquo;to
      hear such words to come from her mild nature and Christian learned
      conscience, as she spake concerning God&rsquo;s holy ordinance and institution
      of matrimony.&rdquo; Burleigh prevailed on her to connive at the marriages of
      churchmen. But she would only connive; and the children sprung from such
      marriages were illegitimate till the accession of James the First.
    </p>
    <p>
      That which is, as we have said, the great stain on the character of
      Burleigh is also the great stain on the character of Elizabeth. Being
      herself an Adiaphorist, having no scruple about conforming to the Romish
      Church when conformity was necessary to her own safety, retaining to the
      last moment of her life a fondness for much of the doctrine and much of
      the ceremonial of that church, she yet subjected that church to a
      persecution even more odious than the persecution with which her sister
      had harassed the Protestants. We say more odious. For Mary had at least
      the plea of fanaticism. She did nothing for her religion which she was not
      prepared to suffer for it. She had held it firmly under persecution. She
      fully believed it to be essential to salvation. If she burned the bodies
      of her <span class="pagenum">32</span><a name="link32" id="link32"></a>subjects,
      it was in order to rescue their souls. Elizabeth had no such pretext. In
      opinion, she was little more than half a Protestant. She had professed,
      when it suited her, to be wholly a Catholic. There is an excuse, a
      wretched excuse, for the massacres of Piedmont and the <i>Autos de fe</i>
      of Spain. But what can be said in defence of a ruler who is at once
      indifferent and intolerant?
    </p>
    <p>
      If the great Queen, whose memory is still held in just veneration by
      Englishmen, had possessed sufficient virtue and sufficient enlargement of
      mind to adopt those principles which More, wiser in speculation than in
      action, had avowed in the preceding generation, and by which the excellent
      L&rsquo;Hospital regulated his conduct in her own time, how different would be
      the colour of the whole history of the last two hundred and fifty years!
      She had the happiest opportunity ever vouchsafed to any sovereign of
      establishing perfect freedom of conscience throughout her dominions,
      without danger to her government, without scandal to any large party among
      her subjects. The nation, as it was clearly ready to profess either
      religion, would, beyond all doubt, have been ready to tolerate both.
      Unhappily for her own glory and for the public peace, she adopted a policy
      from the effects of which the empire is still suffering. The yoke of the
      Established Church was pressed down on the people till they would bear it
      no longer. Then a reaction came. Another reaction followed. To the tyranny
      of the establishment succeeded the tumultuous conflict of sects,
      infuriated by manifold wrongs, and drunk with unwonted freedom. To the
      conflict of sects succeeded again the cruel domination of one persecuting
      church. At length oppression put off its most horrible form, and took a
      milder <span class="pagenum">33</span><a name="link33" id="link33"></a>aspect.
      The penal laws which had been framed for the protection of the established
      church were abolished. But exclusions and disabilities still remained.
      These exclusions and disabilities, after having generated the most fearful
      discontents, after having rendered all government in one part of the
      kingdom impossible, after having brought the state to the very brink of
      ruin, have, in our times, been removed, but, though removed, have left
      behind them a rankling which may last for many years. It is melancholy to
      think with what ease Elizabeth might have united all conflicting sects
      under the shelter of the same impartial laws and the same paternal throne,
      and thus have placed the nation in the same situation, as far as the
      rights of conscience are concerned, in which we at last stand, after all
      the heart-burnings, the persecutions, the conspiracies, the seditions, the
      revolutions, the judicial murders, the civil wars of ten generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the dark side of her character. Yet she surely was a great woman.
      Of all the sovereigns who exercised a power which was seemingly absolute,
      but which in fact depended for support on the love and confidence of their
      subjects, she was by far the most illustrious. It has often been alleged
      as an excuse for the misgovernment of her successors that they only
      followed her example, that precedents might be found in the transactions
      of her reign for persecuting the Puritans, for levying money without the
      sanction of the House of Commons, for confining men without bringing them
      to trial, for interfering with the liberty of parliamentary debate. All
      this may be true. But it is no good plea for her successors; and for this
      plain reason, that they were her successors. She governed one generation,
      they governed another; and between <span class="pagenum">34</span><a
      name="link34" id="link34"></a>the two generations there was almost as
      little in common as between the people of two different countries. It was
      not by looking at the particular measures which Elizabeth had adopted, but
      by looking at the great general principles of her government, that those
      who followed her were likely to learn the art of managing untractable
      subjects. If, instead of searching the records of her reign for precedents
      which might seem to vindicate the mutilation of Prynne and the
      imprisonment of Eliot, the Stuarts had attempted to discover the
      fundamental rules which guided her conduct in all her dealings with her
      people, they would have perceived that their policy was then most unlike
      to hers, when to a superficial observer it would have seemed most to
      resemble hers. Firm, haughty, sometimes unjust and cruel in her
      proceedings towards individuals or towards small parties, she avoided with
      care, or retracted with speed, every measure which seemed likely to
      alienate the great mass of the people. She gained more honour and more
      love by the manner in which she repaired her errors than she would have
      gained by never committing errors. If such a man as Charles the First had
      been in her place when the whole nation was crying out against the
      monopolies, he would have refused all redress. He would have dissolved the
      Parliament, and imprisoned the most popular members. He would have called
      another Parliament. He would have given some vague and delusive promises
      of relief in return for subsidies. When entreated to fulfil his promises,
      he would have again dissolved the Parliament, and again imprisoned his
      leading opponents. The country would have become more agitated than
      before. The next House of Commons would have been more unmanageable than
      <span class="pagenum">35</span><a name="link35" id="link35"></a>that which
      preceded it. The tyrant would have agreed to all that the nation demanded.
      He would have solemnly ratified an act abolishing monopolies forever. He
      would have received a large supply in return for this concession; and
      within half a year new patents, more oppressive than those which had been
      cancelled, would have been issued by scores. Such was the policy which
      brought the heir of a long line of kings, in early youth the darling of
      his countrymen, to a prison and a scaffold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth, before the House of Commons could address her, took out of
      their mouths the words which they were about to utter in the name of the
      nation. Her promises went beyond their desires. Her performance followed
      close upon her promise. She did not treat the nation as an adverse party,
      as a party which had an interest opposed to hers, as a party to which she
      was to grant as few advantages as possible, and from which she was to
      extort as much money as possible. Her benefits were given, not sold; and,
      when once given, they were never withdrawn. She gave them too with a
      frankness, an effusion of heart, a princely dignity, a motherly
      tenderness, which enhanced their value. They were received by the sturdy
      country gentlemen who had come up to Westminster full of resentment, with
      tears of joy, and shouts of &ldquo;God save the Queen.&rdquo; Charles the First gave
      up half the prerogatives of his crown to the Commons; and the Commons sent
      him in return the Grand Remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had intended to say something concerning that illustrious group of
      which Elizabeth is the central figure, that group which the last of the
      bards saw in vision from the top of Snowdon, encircling the Virgin Queen,
      <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"Many a baron bold, <br /><span

      intended to say something concerning the dexterous Walsingham, the
      impetuous Oxford, the graceful Sackville, the all-accomplished Sydney;
      concerning Essex, the ornament of the court and of the camp, the model of
      chivalry, the munificent patron of genius, whom great virtues, great
      courage, great talents, the favour of his sovereign, the love of his
      countrymen, all that seemed to ensure a happy and glorious life, led to an
      early and an ignominious death; concerning Raleigh, the soldier, the
      sailor, the scholar, the courtier, the orator, the poet, the historian,
      the philosopher, whom we picture to ourselves, sometimes reviewing the
      Queen&rsquo;s guard, sometimes giving chase to a Spanish galleon, then answering
      the chiefs of the country party in the House of Commons, then again
      murmuring one of his sweet love-songs too near the ears of her Highness&rsquo;s
      maids of honour, and soon after pouring over the Talmud, or collating
      Polybins with Livy. We had intended also to say something concerning the
      literature of that splendid period, and especially concerning those two
      incomparable men, the Prince of Poets, and the Prince of Philosophers, who
      have made the Elizabethan age a more glorious and important era in the
      history of the human mind than the age of Pericles, of Augustus, or of
      Loo. But subjects so vast require a space far larger than we can at
      present afford. We therefore stop here, fearing that, if we proceed, our
      article may swell to a bulk exceeding that of all other reviews, as much
      as Dr. Nares&rsquo;s book exceeds the bulk of all other histories.

      In his walk through life there was no obtrusiveness, no pushing, no

      redounded from the full measure of their glory. Not that he was of a
      servile and idolatrous habit of mind:&mdash;not that he was one of the

     ouvrage posthume publié par M. J. L. Duval, Membre du
     Conseil Représentatif du Canton du Genève. 8vo. Paris: 1832.

      intellectual castes. Possessed of talents and acquirements which made him
      great, he wished only to be useful. In the prime of manhood, at the very
      time of life at which ambitious men are most ambitious, he was not
      solicitous to proclaim that he furnished information, arguments, and
      eloquence to Mirabeau. In his later years he was perfectly willing that
      his renown should merge in that of Mr. Bentham.
    </p>
    <p>
      The services which M. Dumont has rendered to society can be fully
      appreciated only by those who have studied Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s works, both in
      their rude and in their finished state. The difference both for show and
      for use is as great as the difference between a lump of golden ore and a
      rouleau of sovereigns fresh from the mint. Of Mr. Bentham we would at all
      times speak with the reverence which is due to a great original thinker,
      and to a sincere and ardent friend of the human race. If a few weaknesses
      were mingled with his eminent virtues,&mdash;if a few errors insinuated
      themselves among the many valuable truths which he taught,&mdash;this is
      assuredly no time for noticing those weaknesses or those errors in an
      unkind or sarcastic spirit. A great man has gone from among us, full of
      years, of good works, and of deserved honours. In some of the highest
      departments in which the human intellect can exert itself he has not left
      his equal or his second behind him. From his contemporaries he has had,
      according to the usual lot, more or less than justice. He has had blind
      flatterers and blind detractors&mdash;flatterers who could see nothing but
      perfection in his style, detractors who could see nothing but nonsense in
      his matter. He will now have judges. Posterity will pronounce its calm and
      impartial decision; and that decision will, we firmly believe, place in
      the same rank <span class="pagenum">39</span><a name="link39" id="link39"></a>with
      Galileo, and with Locke, the man who found jurisprudence a gibberish and
      left it a science. Never was there a literary partnership so fortunate as
      that of Mr. Bentham and M. Dumont. The raw material which Mr. Bentham
      furnished was most precious; but it was unmarketable. He was, assuredly,
      at once a great logician and a great rhetorician. But the effect of his
      logic was injured by a vicious arrangement, and the effect or his rhetoric
      by a vicious style. His mind was vigorous, comprehensive, subtle, fertile
      of arguments, fertile of illustrations. But he spoke in an unknown tongue;
      and, that the congregation might be edified, it was necessary that some
      brother having the gift of interpretation should expound the invaluable
      jargon. His oracles were of high import; but they were traced on leaves
      and flung loose to the wind. So negligent was he of the arts of selection,
      distribution, and compression, that to persons who formed their judgment
      of him from his works in their undigested state he seemed to be the least
      systematic of all philosophers. The truth is, that his opinions formed a
      system, which, whether sound or unsound, is more exact, more entire, and
      more consistent with itself than any other. Yet to superficial readers of
      his works in their original form, and indeed to all readers of those works
      who did not bring great industry and great acuteness to the study, he
      seemed to be a man of a quick and ingenious but ill-regulated mind,&mdash;who
      saw truth only by glimpses,&mdash;who threw out many striking hints, but
      who had never thought of combining his doctrines in one harmonious whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Dumont was admirably qualified to supply what was wanting in Mr.
      Bentham. In the qualities in which the French writers surpass those of all
      other nations,&mdash;<span class="pagenum">40</span><a name="link40"
       id="link40"></a>neatness, clearness, precision, condensation,&mdash;he
      surpassed all French writers. If M. Dumont had never been horn, Mr.
      Bentham would still have been a very great man. But he would have been
      great to himself alone. The fertility of his mind would have resembled the
      fertility of those vast American wildernesses in which blossoms and decays
      a rich but unprofitable vegetation, &ldquo;wherewith the reaper filleth not his
      hand, neither he that bindeth up the sheaves his bosom.&rdquo; It would have
      been with his discoveries as it has been with the &ldquo;Century of Inventions.&rdquo;
       His speculations on laws would have been of no more practical use than
      Lord Worcester&rsquo;s speculations on steam-engines. Some generations hence,
      perhaps, when legislation had found its Watt, an antiquarian might have
      published to the world the curious fact, that, in the reign of George the
      Third, there had been a man called Bentham, who had given hints of many
      discoveries made since his time, and who had really, for his age, taken a
      most philosophical view of the principles of jurisprudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many persons have attempted to interpret between this powerful mind and
      the public. But, in our opinion, M. Dumont alone has succeeded. It is
      remarkable that, in foreign countries, where Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s works are known
      solely through the medium of the French version, his merit is almost
      universally acknowledged. Even those who are most decidedly opposed to his
      political opinions&mdash;the very chiefs of the Holy Alliance&mdash;have
      publicly testified their respect for him. In England, on the contrary,
      many persons who certainly entertained no prejudice against him on
      political grounds were long in the habit of mentioning him contemptuously.
      Indeed, what was said <span class="pagenum">41</span><a name="link41"
       id="link41"></a>of Bacon&rsquo;s Philosophy may be said of Bentham&rsquo;s. It was in
      little repute among us, till judgments in its favour came from beyond sea,
      and convinced us, to our shame, that we had been abusing and laughing at
      one of the greatest men of the age.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Dumont might easily have found employments more gratifying to personal
      vanity than that of arranging works not his own. But he could have found
      no employment more useful or more truly honourable. The book before us,
      hastily written as it is, contains abundant proof, if proof were needed,
      that he did not become an editor because he wanted the talents which would
      have made him eminent as a writer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Persons who hold democratical opinions, and who have been accustomed to
      consider M. Dumont as one of their party, have been surprised and
      mortified to learn that he speaks with very little respect of the French
      Revolution and of its authors. Some zealous Tories have naturally
      expressed great satisfaction at finding their doctrines, in some respects,
      confirmed by the testimony of an unwilling witness. The date of the work,
      we think, explains every thing. If it had been written ten years earlier,
      or twenty years later, it would have been very different from what it is.
      It was written, neither during the first excitement of the Revolution, nor
      at that later period when the practical good produced by the Revolution
      had become manifest to the most prejudiced observers; but in those
      wretched times when the enthusiasm had abated, and the solid advantages
      were not yet fully seen. It was written in the year 1799,&mdash;a year in
      which the most sanguine friend of liberty might well feel some misgivings
      as to the effects of what the National Assembly had done. The evils which
      attend every great change had been <span class="pagenum">42</span><a
      name="link42" id="link42"></a>severely felt. The benefit was still to
      come. The price&mdash;a heavy price&mdash;had been paid. The thing
      purchased had not yet been delivered. Europe was swarming with French
      exiles. The fleets and armies of the second coalition were victorious.
      Within France, the reign of terror was over; but the reign of law had not
      commenced. There had been, indeed, during three or four years, a written
      Constitution, by which rights were defined and checks provided. But these
      rights had been repeatedly violated; and those checks had proved utterly
      inefficient. The laws which had been framed to secure the distinct
      authority of the executive magistrates and of the legislative assemblies&mdash;the
      freedom of election&mdash;the freedom of debate&mdash;the freedom of the
      press&mdash;the personal freedom of citizens&mdash;were a dead letter. The
      ordinary mode in which the Republic was governed was by <i>coups d&rsquo;état</i>.
      On one occasion, the legislative councils were placed under military
      restraint by the directors. Then, again, directors were deposed by the
      legislative councils. Elections were set aside by the executive authority.
      Shiploads of writers and speakers were sent, without a legal trial, to die
      of fever in Guiana. France, in short, was in that state in which
      revolutions, effected by violence, almost always leave a nation. The habit
      of obedience had been lost. The spell of prescription had been broken.
      Those associations on which, far more than on any arguments about property
      and order, the authority of magistrates rests had completely passed away.
      The power of the government consisted merely in the physical force which
      it could bring to its support. Moral force it had none. It was itself a
      government sprung from a recent convulsion. Its own fundamental maxim was,
      that rebellion might be justifiable. <span class="pagenum">43</span><a
      name="link43" id="link43"></a>Its own existence proved that rebellion
      might be successful. The people had been accustomed, during several years,
      to offer resistance to the constituted authorities on the slightest
      provocation, and to see the constituted authorities yield to that
      resistance. The whole political world was &ldquo;without form and void&rdquo;&mdash;an
      incessant whirl of hostile atoms, which, every moment, formed some new
      combination. The only man who could fix the agitated elements of society
      in a stable form was following a wild vision of glory and empire through
      the Syrian deserts. The time was not yet come, when <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">"Confusion heard his voice; and wild uproar <br /><span
      class="indent20">Stood ruled:&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      when, out of the chaos into which the old society had been resolved, were
      to rise a new dynasty, a new peerage, a new church, and a new code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dying words of Madame Roland, &ldquo;Oh Liberty! how many crimes are
      committed in thy name!&rdquo; were at that time echoed by many of the most
      upright and benevolent of mankind. M. Guizot has, in one of his admirable
      pamphlets, happily and justly described M. Laine as &ldquo;an honest and liberal
      man discouraged by the Revolution.&rdquo; This description, at the time when M.
      Dumont&rsquo;s Memoirs were written, would have applied to almost every honest
      and liberal man in Europe; and would, beyond all doubt, have applied to M.
      Dumont himself. To that fanatical worship of the all-wise and all-good
      people, which had been common a few years before, had succeeded an uneasy
      suspicion that the follies and vices of the people would frustrate all
      attempts to serve them. The wild and joyous exultation with which the
      meeting of the States-General <span class="pagenum">44</span><a
      name="link44" id="link44"></a>and the fall of the Bastile had been hailed,
      had passed away. In its place was dejection, and a gloomy distrust of
      specious appearances. The philosophers and philanthropists had reigned.
      And what had their reign produced? Philosophy had brought with it
      mummeries as absurd as any which had been practised by the most
      superstitious zealot of the darkest age. Philanthropy had brought with it
      crimes as horrible as the massacre of St. Bartholomew. This was the
      emancipation of the human mind. These were the fruits of the great victory
      of reason over prejudice. France had rejected the faith of Pascal and
      Descartes as a nursery fable, that a courtezan might be her idol, and a
      madman her priest. She had asserted her freedom against Louis, that she
      might bow down before Robespierre. For a time men thought that all the
      boasted wisdom of the eighteenth century was folly: and that those hopes
      of great political and social ameliorations which had been cherished by
      Voltaire and Condorcet were utterly delusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the influence of these feelings, M. Dumont has gone so far as to say
      that the writings of Mr. Burke on the French Revolution, though disfigured
      by exaggeration, and though containing doctrines subversive of all public
      liberty, had been, on the whole, justified by events, and had probably
      saved Europe from great disasters. That such a man as the friend and
      fellow-labourer of Mr. Bentham should have expressed such an opinion is a
      circumstance which well deserves the consideration of uncharitable
      politicians. These Memoirs have not convinced us that the French
      Revolution was not a great blessing to mankind. But they have convinced us
      that very great indulgence is due to those who, while the Revolution was
      actually <span class="pagenum">45</span><a name="link45" id="link45"></a>taking
      place, regarded it with unmixed aversion and horror. We can perceive where
      their error lay. We can perceive that the evil was temporary, and the good
      durable. But we cannot be sure that, if our lot had been cast in their
      times, we should not, like them, have been discouraged and disgusted&mdash;that
      we should not, like them, have seen, in that great victory of the French
      people, only insanity and crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is curious to observe how some men are applauded, and others reviled,
      for merely being what all their neighbours are,&mdash;for merely going
      passively down the stream of events,&mdash;for merely representing the
      opinions and passions of a whole generation. The friends of popular
      government ordinarily speak with extreme severity of Mr. Pitt, and with
      respect and tenderness of Mr. Canning. Yet the whole difference, we
      suspect, consisted merely in this,&mdash;that Mr. Pitt died in 1806, and
      Mr. Canning in 1827. During the years which were common to the public life
      of both, Mr. Canning was assuredly not a more liberal statesman than his
      patron. The truth is, that Mr. Pitt began his political life at the end of
      the American War, when the nation was suffering from the effects of
      corruption. He closed it in the midst of the calamities produced by the
      French Revolution, when the nation was still strongly impressed with the
      horrors of anarchy. He changed, undoubtedly. In his youth he had brought
      in reform bills. In his manhood he brought in gagging bills. But the
      change, though lamentable, was, in our opinion, perfectly natural, and
      might have been perfectly honest. He changed with the great body of his
      countrymen. Mr. Canning, on the other hand, entered into public life when
      Europe was in dread of the Jacobins. He closed his public life when Europe
      was suffering under <span class="pagenum">46</span><a name="link46"
       id="link46"></a>the tyranny of the Holy Alliance. He, too, changed with
      the nation. As the crimes of the Jacobins had turned the master into
      something very like a Tory, the events which followed the Congress of
      Vienna turned the pupil into something very like a Whig.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much are men the creatures of circumstances. We see that, if M. Dumont
      had died in 1799, he would have died, to use the new cant word, a decided
      &ldquo;Conservative.&rdquo; If Mr. Pitt had lived in 1832, it is our firm belief that
      he would have been a decided Reformer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judgment passed by M. Dumont in this work on the French Revolution
      must be taken with considerable allowances. It resembles a criticism on a
      play of which only the first act has been performed, or on a building from
      which the scaffolding has not yet been taken down. We have no doubt that,
      if the excellent author had revised these memoirs thirty years after the
      time at which they were written, he would have seen reason to omit a few
      passages, and to add many qualifications and explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would not probably have been inclined to retract the censures, just,
      though severe, which he has passed on the ignorance, the presumption, and
      the pedantry, of the National Assembly. But he would have admitted that,
      in spite of those faults, perhaps even by reason of those faults, that
      Assembly had conferred inestimable benefits on mankind. It is clear that,
      among the French of that day, political knowledge was absolutely in its
      infancy. It would indeed have been strange if it had attained maturity in
      the time of censors, of <i>lettres-de-cachet</i>, and of beds of justice.
      The electors did not know how to elect. The representatives did not know
      how to deliberate. M. Dumont taught the constituent body of Montreuil how
      to perform their functions, and <span class="pagenum">47</span><a
      name="link47" id="link47"></a>found them apt to learn. He afterwards
      tried, in concert with Mirabeau, to instruct the National Assembly in that
      admirable system of Parliamentary tactics which has been long established
      in the English House of Commons, and which has made the House of Commons,
      in spite of all the defects in its composition, the best and fairest
      debating society in the world. But these accomplished legislators, though
      quite as ignorant as the mob of Montreuil, proved much less docile, and
      cried out that they did not want to go to school to the English. Their
      debates consisted of endless successions of trashy pamphlets, all
      beginning with something about the original compact of society, man in the
      hunting state, and other such foolery. They sometimes diversified and
      enlivened these long readings by a little rioting. They bawled; they
      hooted; they shook their fists. They kept no order among themselves. They
      were insulted with impunity by the crowd which filled their galleries.
      They gave long and solemn considerations to trifles. They hurried through
      the most important resolutions with fearful expedition. They wasted months
      in quibbling about the words of that false and childish Declaration of
      Rights on which they professed to found their new constitution, and which
      was at irreconcilable variance with every clause of that constitution.
      They annihilated in a single night privileges, many of which partook of
      the nature of property, and ought therefore to have been most delicately
      handled.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are called the Constituent Assembly. Never was a name less
      appropriate. They were not constituent, but the very reverse of
      constituent. They constituted nothing that stood or that deserved to last.
      They had not, and they could not possibly have, the information or the
      habits of mind which are necessary <span class="pagenum">48</span><a
      name="link48" id="link48"></a>for the framing of that most exquisite of
      all machines&mdash;a government. The metaphysical cant with which they
      prefaced their constitution has long been the scoff of all parties. Their
      constitution itself,&mdash;that constitution which they described as
      absolutely perfect, and to which they predicted immortality,&mdash;disappeared
      in a few months, and left no trace behind it. They were great only in the
      work of destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glory of the National Assembly is this, that they were in truth, what
      Mr. Burke called them in austere irony, the ablest architects of ruin that
      ever the world saw. They were utterly incompetent to perform any work
      which required a discriminating eye and a skilful hand. But the work which
      was then to be done was a work of devastation. They had to deal with
      abuses so horrible and so deeply rooted that the highest political wisdom
      could scarcely have produced greater good to mankind than was produced by
      their fierce and senseless temerity. Demolition is undoubtedly a vulgar
      task; the highest glory of the statesman is to construct. But there is a
      time for every thing,&mdash;a time to set up, and a time to pull down. The
      talents of revolutionary leaders and those of the legislator have equally
      their use and their season. It is the natural, the almost universal, law,
      that the age of insurrections, and proscriptions shall precede the age of
      good government, of temperate liberty, and liberal order.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how should it be otherwise? It is not in swaddling-bands that we learn
      to walk. It is not in the dark that we learn to distinguish colours. It is
      not under oppression that we learn how to use freedom. The ordinary
      sophism by which misrule is defended is, when truly stated, this:&mdash;The
      people must continue <span class="pagenum">49</span><a name="link49"
       id="link49"></a>in slavery, because slavery has generated in them all the
      vices of slaves. Because they are ignorant, they must remain under a power
      which has made and which keeps them ignorant. Because they have been made
      ferocious by misgovernment, they must be misgoverned for ever. If the
      system under which they live were so mild and liberal that under its
      operation they had become humane and enlightened, it would be safe to
      venture on a change. But, as this system has destroyed morality, and
      prevented the development of the intellect,&mdash;as it has turned men,
      who might under different training have formed a virtuous and happy
      community, into savage and stupid wild beasts,&mdash;therefore it ought to
      last for ever. The English Revolution, it is said, was truly a glorious
      Revolution. Practical evils were redressed; no excesses were committed; no
      sweeping confiscations took place; the authority of the laws was scarcely
      for a moment suspended; the fullest and freest discussion was tolerated in
      Parliament; the nation showed, by the calm and temperate manner in which
      it asserted its liberty, that it was fit to enjoy liberty. The French
      Revolution was, on the other hand, the most horrible event recorded in
      history,&mdash;all madness and wickedness,&mdash;absurdity in theory, and
      atrocity in practice. What folly and injustice in the revolutionary laws!
      What grotesque affectation in the revolutionary ceremonies! What
      fanaticism! What licentiousness! What cruelty! Anacharsis Clootz and
      Marat,&mdash;feasts of the Supreme Being, and marriages of the Loire&mdash;trees
      of liberty, and heads dancing on pikes&mdash;the whole forms a kind of
      infernal farce, made up of every thing ridiculous, and every thing
      frightful. This it is to give freedom to those who have neither wisdom nor
      virtue. <span class="pagenum">50</span><a name="link50" id="link50"></a>It
      is not only by bad men interested in the defence of abuses that arguments
      like these have been urged against all schemes of political improvement.
      Some of the highest and purest of human beings conceived such scorn and
      aversion for the follies and crimes of the French Revolution that they
      recanted, in the moment of triumph, those liberal opinions to which they
      had clung in defiance of persecution. And, if we inquire why it was that
      they began to doubt whether liberty were a blessing, we shall find that it
      was only because events had proved, in the clearest manner, that liberty
      is the parent of virtue and of order. They ceased to abhor tyranny merely
      because it had been signally shown that the effect of tyranny on the
      hearts and understandings of men is more demoralising and more stupifying
      than had ever been imagined by the most zealous friend of moral rights.
      The truth is, that a stronger argument against the old monarchy of France
      maybe drawn from the <i>noyades</i> and the <i>fusillades</i> than from
      the Bastile and the <i>Parc-aux-cerfs</i>. We believe it to be a rule
      without an exception, that the violence of a revolution corresponds to the
      degree of misgovernment which has produced that revolution. Why was the
      French Revolution so bloody and destructive? Why was our revolution of
      1641 comparatively mild? Why was our revolution of 1688 milder still? Why
      was the American Revolution, considered as an internal movement, the
      mildest of all? There is an obvious and complete solution of the problem.
      The English under James the First and Charles the First were less
      oppressed than the French under Louis the Fifteenth and Louis the
      Sixteenth. The English were less oppressed after the Restoration than
      before the great Rebellion. And America under George the Third was less
      oppressed than England under the Stuarts. The re-action <span
      class="pagenum">51</span><a name="link51" id="link51"></a>was exactly
      proportioned to the pressure,&mdash;the vengeance to the provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Burke was reminded in his later years of the zeal which he had
      displayed in the cause of the Americans, he vindicated himself from the
      charge of inconsistency, by contrasting the wisdom and moderation of the
      Colonial insurgents of 1776 with the fanaticism and wickedness of the
      Jacobins of 1792. He was in fact bringing an argument <i>a fortiori</i>
      against himself. The circumstances on which he rested his vindication,
      fully proved that the old government of France stood in far more need of a
      complete change than the old government of America. The difference between
      Washington and Robespierre,&mdash;the difference between Franklin and
      Barere,&mdash;the difference between the destruction of a few barrels of
      tea and the confiscation of thousands of square, miles,&mdash;the
      difference between the tarring and feathering of a tax-gatherer and the
      massacres of September,&mdash;measure the difference between the
      government of America under the rule of England and the government of
      France under the rule of the Bourbons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis the Sixteenth made great voluntary concessions to his people; and
      they sent him to the scaffold. Charles the Tenth violated the fundamental
      laws of the state, established a despotism, and butchered his subjects for
      not submitting quietly to that despotism. He failed in his wicked attempt.
      He was at the mercy of those whom he had injured. The pavements of Paris
      were still heaped up in barricades;&mdash;the hospitals were still full of
      the wounded;&mdash;the dead were still unburied;&mdash;a thousand families
      were in mourning;&mdash;a hundred thousand citizens were in arms. The
      crime was recent;&mdash;the life of the criminal was in the hands <span
      class="pagenum">52</span><a name="link52" id="link52"></a>of the
      sufferers;&mdash;and they touched not one hair of his head. In the first,
      revolution, victims were sent to death by scores for the most trifling
      acts proved by the lowest testimony, before the most partial tribunals.
      After the second revolution, those ministers who had signed the
      ordinances,&mdash;those ministers, whose guilt, as it was of the foulest
      kind, was proved by the clearest evidence,&mdash;were punished only with
      imprisonment. In the first revolution, property was attacked. In the
      second, it was held sacred. Both revolutions, it is true, left the public
      mind of France in an unsettled state. Both revolutions were followed by
      insurrectionary movements. But, after the first revolution, the insurgents
      were almost always stronger than the law; and, since the second
      revolution, the law has invariably been found stronger than the
      insurgents. There is, indeed, much in the present state of France which
      may well excite the uneasiness of those who desire to see her free, happy,
      powerful, and secure. Yet, if we compare the present state of France with
      the state in which she was forty years ago, how vast a change for the
      better has taken place! How little effect, for example, during the first
      revolution, would the sentence of a judicial body have produced on an
      armed and victorious body! If, after the 10th of August, or after the
      proscription of the Gironde, or after the 9th of Thermidor, or after the
      carnage of Vendémiaire, or after the arrests of Fructidor, any tribunal
      had decided against the conquerors in favour of the conquered, with what
      contempt, with what derision, would its award have been received! The
      judges would have lost their heads, or would have been sent to die in some
      unwholesome colony. The fate of the victim whom they had endeavoured to
      save would only have been made darker and more hopeless <span
      class="pagenum">53</span><a name="link53" id="link53"></a>by their
      interference. We have lately seen a signal proof that, in France, the law
      is now stronger than the sword. We have seen a government, in the very
      moment of triumph and revenge, submitting itself to the authority of a
      court of law. A just and independent sentence has been pronounced&mdash;a
      sentence worthy of the ancient renown of that magistracy to which belong
      the noblest recollections of French history&mdash;which, in an age of
      persecutors, produced L&rsquo;Hôpital,&mdash;which, in an age of courtiers,
      produced D&rsquo;Aguesseau&mdash;which, in an age of wickedness and madness,
      exhibited to mankind a pattern of every virtue in the life and in the
      death of Malesherbes. The respectful manner in which that sentence has
      been received is alone sufficient to show how widely the French of this
      generation differ from their fathers. And how is the difference to be
      explained? The race, the soil, the climate are the same. If those dull,
      honest Englishmen, who explain the events of 1793 and 1791 by saying that
      the French are naturally frivolous and cruel, were in the right, why is
      the guillotine now standing idle? Not surely for want of Carlists, of
      aristocrats, of people guilty of incivism, of people suspected of being
      suspicious characters. Is not the true explanation this, that the
      Frenchman of 1832 has been far better governed than the Frenchman of 1798,&mdash;that
      his soul has never been galled by the oppressive privileges of a separate
      caste,&mdash;that he has been in some degree accustomed to discuss
      political questions, and to perform political functions,&mdash;that he has
      lived for seventeen or eighteen years under institutions which, however
      defective, have yet been far superior to any institutions that had before
      existed in France?
    </p>
    <p>
      As the second French Revolution has been far milder <span class="pagenum">54</span><a
      name="link54" id="link54"></a>than the first, so that great change which
      has just been effected in England has been milder even than the second
      French Revolution,&mdash;milder than any revolution recorded in history.
      Some orators have described the reform of the House of Commons as a
      revolution. Others have denied the propriety of the term. The question,
      though in seeming merely a question of definition, suggests much curious
      and interesting matter for reflection. If we look at the magnitude of the
      reform, it may well be called a revolution. If we look at the means by
      which it has been effected, it is merely an act of Parliament, regularly
      brought in, read, committed, and passed. In the whole history of England,
      there is no prouder circumstance than this,&mdash;that a change, which
      could not, in any other age, or in any other country, have been effected
      without physical violence, should here have been effected by the force of
      reason, and under the forms of law. The work of three civil wars has been
      accomplished by three sessions of Parliament. An ancient and deeply rooted
      system of abuses has been fiercely attacked and stubbornly defended. It
      has fallen; and not one sword has been drawn; not one estate has been
      confiscated; not one family has been forced to emigrate. The bank has kept
      its credit. The funds have kept their price. Every man has gone forth to
      his work and to his labour till the evening. During the fiercest
      excitement of the contest,&mdash;during the first fortnight of that
      immortal May,&mdash;there was not one moment at which any sanguinary act
      committed on the person of any of the most unpopular men in England would
      not have filled the country with horror and indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, now that the victory is won, has it been abused? An immense mass of
      power has been transferred <span class="pagenum">55</span><a name="link55"
       id="link55"></a>from an oligarchy to the nation. Are the members of the
      vanquished oligarchy insecure? Does the nation seem disposed to play the
      tyrant? Are not those who, in any other state of society, would have been
      visited with the severest vengeance of the triumphant party,&mdash;would
      have been pining in dungeons, or flying to foreign countries,&mdash;still
      enjoying their possessions and their honours, still taking part as freely
      as ever in public affairs? Two years ago they were dominant. They are now
      vanquished. Yet the whole people would regard with horror any man who
      should dare to propose any vindictive measure. So common is this feeling,&mdash;so
      much is it a matter of course among us,&mdash;that many of our readers
      will scarcely understand what we see to admire in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To what are we to attribute the unparalleled moderation and humanity which
      the English people have displayed at this great conjuncture? The answer is
      plain. This moderation, this humanity, are the fruits of a hundred and
      fifty years of liberty. During many generations we have had legislative
      assemblies which, however defective their constitution might be, have
      always contained many members chosen by the people, and many others eager
      to obtain the approbation of the people;&mdash;assemblies in which perfect
      freedom of debate was allowed;&mdash;assemblies in which the smallest
      minority had a fair hearing;&mdash;assemblies in which abuses, even when
      they were not redressed, were at least exposed. For many generations we
      have had the trial by jury, the Habeas Corpus Act, the freedom of the
      press, the right of meeting to discuss public affairs, the right of
      petitioning the legislature. A vast portion of the population has long
      been accustomed to the exercise of political functions, and has been
      thoroughly <span class="pagenum">56</span><a name="link56" id="link56"></a>seasoned
      to political excitement. In most other countries there is no middle course
      between absolute submission and open rebellion. In England there has
      always been for centuries a constitutional opposition. Thus our
      institutions had been so good that they had educated us into a capacity
      for better institutions. There is not a large town in the kingdom which
      does not contain better materials for a legislature than all France could
      furnish in 1789. There is not a spouting-club at any pot-house in London
      in which the rules of debate are not better understood, and more strictly
      observed than in the Constituent Assembly. There is scarcely a Political
      Union which could not frame in half an hour a declaration of rights
      superior to that which occupied the collective wisdom of France for
      several months.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be impossible even to glance at all the causes of the French
      Revolution, within the limits to which we must confine ourselves. One
      thing is clear. The government, the aristocracy, and the church, were
      rewarded after their works. They reaped that which they had sown. They
      found the nation such as they had made it. That the people had become
      possessed of irresistible power before they had attained the slightest
      knowledge of the art of government&mdash;that practical questions of vast
      moment were left to be solved by men to whom politics had been only matter
      of theory&mdash;that a legislature was composed of persons who were
      scarcely fit to compose a debating society&mdash;that the whole nation was
      ready to lend an ear to any flatterer who appealed to its cupidity, to its
      fears, or to its thirst for vengeance&mdash;all this was the effect of
      misrule, obstinately continued in defiance of solemn warnings, and of the
      visible signs of an approaching retribution. <span class="pagenum">57</span><a
      name="link57" id="link57"></a>Even while the monarchy seemed to be in its
      highest and most palmy state, the causes of that great destruction had
      already begun to operate. They may be distinctly traced even under the
      reign of Louis the Fourteenth. That reign is the time to which the
      Ultra-Royalists refer as the Golden Age of France. It was in truth one of
      those periods which shine with an unnatural and delusive splendour, and
      which are rapidly followed by gloom and decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning Louis the Fourteenth himself, the world seems at last to have
      formed a correct judgment. He was not a great general; he was not a great
      statesman; but he was, in one sense of the words, a great king. Never was
      there so consummate a master of what our James the First would have called
      king-craft,&mdash;of all those arts which most advantageously display the
      merits of a prince, and most completely hide his defects. Though his
      internal administration was bad,&mdash;though the military triumphs which
      gave splendour to the early part of his reign, were not achieved by
      himself,&mdash;though his later years were crowded with defeats and
      humiliations,&mdash;though he was so ignorant that he scarcely understood
      the Latin of his mass-book,&mdash;though he fell under the control of a
      cunning Jesuit, and of a more cunning old woman,&mdash;he succeeded in
      passing himself off on his people as a being above humanity. And this is
      the more extraordinary, because he did not seclude himself from the public
      gaze like those Oriental despots, whose faces are never seen, and whose
      very names it is a crime to pronounce lightly. It has been said that no
      man is a hero to his valet;&mdash;and all the world saw as much of Louis
      the Fourteenth as his valet could see. Five hundred people assembled to
      see him shave and put on his breeches in the morning. <span class="pagenum">58</span><a
      name="link58" id="link58"></a>He then kneeled down at the side of his bed,
      and said his prayer, while the whole assembly awaited the end in solemn
      silence,&mdash;the ecclesiastics on their knees and the laymen with their
      hats before their faces. He walked about his gardens with a train of two
      hundred courtiers at his heels. All Versailles came to see him dine and
      sup. He was put to bed at night in the midst of a crowd as great as that
      which had met to see him rise in the morning. He took his very emetics in
      state, and vomited majestically in the presence of all the <i>grandes</i>
      and <i>petites entrées</i>. Yet, though he constantly exposed himself to
      the public gaze in situations in which it is scarcely possible for any man
      to preserve much personal dignity, he to the last impressed those who
      surrounded him with the deepest awe and reverence. The illusion which he
      produced on his worshippers can be compared only to those illusions to
      which lovers are proverbially subject during the season of courtship. It
      was an illusion which affected even the senses. The contemporaries of
      Louis thought him tall. Voltaire, who might have seen him, and who had
      lived with some of the most distinguished members of his court, speaks
      repeatedly of his majestic stature. Yet it is as certain as any fact can
      be, that he was rather below than above the middle size. He had, it seems,
      a way of holding himself, a way of walking, a way of swelling his chest
      and rearing his head, which deceived the eyes of the multitude. Eighty
      years after his death, the royal cemetery was violated by the
      revolutionists; his coffin was opened; his body was dragged out; and it
      appeared that the prince, whose majestic figure had been so long and
      loudly extolled, was in truth a little man. (1) That fine

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Even M de Chataubriand, to whom we should have thought
     all the Bourbons would have seemed at least six feet high,
     admits this fact. &ldquo;C&rsquo;est une erreur,&rdquo; says he in his strange
     memoirs of the Duke of Berri, &ldquo;de croire que Louis XIV.
     étoit d&rsquo;une haute stature. Une cuirasse qui nous reste de
     lui, et les exhumations de St. Denys, n&rsquo;ont laissé sur ce

      <span class="pagenum">59</span><a name="link59" id="link59"></a>expression

      His person and his government have had the same fate. He had the art of
      making both appear grand and august, in spite of the clearest evidence
      that both were below the ordinary standard. Death and time have exposed
      both the deceptions. The body of the great king has been measured more
      justly than it was measured by the courtiers who were afraid to look above
      his shoe-tie. His public character has been scrutinized by men free from
      the hopes and fears of Boileau and Molière. In the grave, the most
      majestic of princes is only five feet eight. In history, the hero and the
      politician dwindles into a vain and feeble tyrant,&mdash;the slave of
      priests and women,&mdash;little in war,&mdash;little in government,&mdash;little
      in every thing but the art of simulating greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left to his infant successor a famished and miserable people, a beaten
      and humbled army, provinces turned into deserts by misgovernment and
      persecution, factions dividing the court, a schism raging in the church,
      an immense debt, an empty treasury, immeasurable palaces, an innumerable
      household, inestimable jewels and furniture. All the sap and nutriment of
      the state seemed to have been drawn to feed one bloated and unwholesome
      excrescence. The nation was withered. The court was morbidly flourishing.
      <span class="pagenum">60</span><a name="link60" id="link60"></a>Yet it
      does not appear that the associations which attached the people to the
      monarchy had lost strength during his reign. He had neglected or
      sacrificed their dearest interests; but he had struck their imaginations.
      The very things which ought to have made him most unpopular,&mdash;the
      prodigies of luxury and magnificence with which his person was surrounded,
      while, beyond the inclosure of his parks, nothing was to be seen but
      starvation and despair,&mdash;seemed to increase the respectful attachment
      which his subjects felt for him. That governments exist only for the good
      of the people, appears to be the most obvious and simple of all truths.
      Yet history proves that it is one of the most recondite. We can scarcely
      wonder that it should be so seldom present to the minds of rulers, when we
      see how slowly, and through how much suffering, nations arrive at the
      knowledge of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was indeed one Frenchman who had discovered those principles which
      it now seems impossible to miss,&mdash;that the many are not made for the
      use of one,&mdash;that the truly good government is not that which
      concentrates magnificence in a court, but that which diffuses happiness
      among a people,&mdash;that a king who gains victory after victory, and
      adds province to province, may deserve, not the admiration, but the
      abhorrence and contempt of mankind. These were the doctrines which Fénelon
      taught. Considered as an epic poem, Telemachus can scarcely be placed
      above Glover&rsquo;s Leonidas or Wilkie&rsquo;s Epigoniad. Considered as a treatise on
      politics and morals, it abounds with errors of detail; and the truths
      which it inculcates seem trite to a modern reader. But, if we compare the
      spirit in which it is written with the spirit which pervades the rest of
      the French literature <span class="pagenum">61</span><a name="link61"
       id="link61"></a>of that age, we shall perceive that, though in appearance
      trite, it was in truth one of the most original works that have ever
      appeared. The fundamental principles of Fenelon&rsquo;s political morality, the
      tests by which he judged of institutions and of men, were absolutely new
      to his countrymen. He had taught them indeed, with the happiest effect, to
      his royal pupil. But how incomprehensible they were to most people, we
      learn from Saint Simon. That amusing writer tells us, as a thing almost
      incredible, that the Duke of Burgundy declared it to be his opinion that
      kings existed for the good of the people, and not the people for the good
      of kings. Saint Simon is delighted with the benevolence of this saying;
      but startled by its novelty, and terrified by its boldness. Indeed he
      distinctly says that it was not safe to repeat the sentiment in the court
      of Louis. Saint Simon was, of all the members of that court, the least
      courtly. He was as nearly an oppositionist as any man of his time. His
      disposition was proud, bitter, and cynical. In religion he was a
      Jansenist; in politics, a less hearty royalist than most of his
      neighbours. His opinions and his temper had preserved him from the
      illusions which the demeanour of Louis produced on others. He neither
      loved nor respected the king. Yet even this man,&mdash;one of the most
      liberal men in France,&mdash;was struck dumb with astonishment at hearing
      the fundamental axiom of all government propounded,&mdash;an axiom which,
      in our time, nobody in England or France would dispute,&mdash;which the
      stoutest Tory takes for granted as much as the fiercest Radical, and
      concerning which the Carlist would agree with the most republican deputy
      of the &ldquo;extreme left.&rdquo; No person will do justice to Fenelon, who does not
      <span class="pagenum">62</span><a name="link62" id="link62"></a>constantly
      keep in mind that Telemachus was written in an age and nation in which
      bold and independent thinkers stared to hear that twenty millions of human
      beings did not exist for the gratification of one. That work is commonly
      considered as a school-book, very fit for children, because its style is
      easy and its morality blameless, but unworthy of the attention of
      statesmen and philosophers. We can distinguish in it, if we are not
      greatly mistaken, the first faint dawn of a long and splendid day of
      intellectual light,&mdash;the dim promise of a great deliverance,&mdash;the
      undeveloped germ of the charter and of the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      What mighty interests were staked on the life of the Duke of Burgundy! and
      how different an aspect might the history of France have borne if he had
      attained the age of his grandfather or of his son;&mdash;if he had been
      permitted to show how much could be done for humanity by the highest
      virtue in the highest fortune! There is scarcely anything in history more
      remarkable than the descriptions which remain to us of that extraordinary
      man. The fierce and impetuous temper which he showed in early youth,&mdash;the
      complete change which a judicious education produced in his character,&mdash;his
      fervid piety,&mdash;his large benevolence,&mdash;the strictness with which
      he judged himself,&mdash;the liberality with which he judged others,&mdash;the
      fortitude with which alone, in the whole court, he stood up against the
      commands of Louis, when a religious scruple was concerned,&mdash;the
      charity with which alone, in the whole court, he defended the profligate
      Orleans against calumniators,&mdash;his great projects for the good of the
      people,&mdash;his activity in business,&mdash;his taste for letters,&mdash;his
      strong domestic attachments,&mdash;even the ungraceful person and the shy
      and awkward manner which concealed <span class="pagenum">63</span><a
      name="link63" id="link63"></a>from the eyes of the sneering courtiers of
      his grandfather so many rare endowments,&mdash;make his character the most
      interesting that is to be found in the annals of his house. He had
      resolved, if he came to the throne, to disperse that ostentatious court,
      which was supported at an expense ruinous to the nation,&mdash;to preserve
      peace,&mdash;to correct the abuses which were found in every part of the
      system of revenue,&mdash;to abolish or modify oppressive privileges,&mdash;to
      reform the administration of justice,&mdash;to revive the institution of
      the States General. If he had ruled over France during forty or fifty
      years, that great movement of the human mind, which no government could
      have arrested, which bad government only rendered more violent, would, we
      are inclined to think, have been conducted, by peaceable means, to a happy
      termination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disease and sorrow removed from the world that wisdom and virtue of which
      it was not worthy. During two generations France was ruled by men who,
      with all the vices of Louis the Fourteenth, had none of the art by which
      that magnificent prince passed off his vices for virtues. The people had
      now to see tyranny naked. That foul Duessa was stripped of her gorgeous
      ornaments. She had always been hideous; but a strange enchantment had made
      her seem fair and glorious in the eyes of her willing slaves. The spell
      was now broken; the deformity was made manifest; and the lovers, lately so
      happy and so proud, turned away loathing and horror-struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      First came the Regency. The strictness, with which Louis had, towards the
      close of his life, exacted from those around him an outward attention to
      religious duties, produced an effect similar to that which the rigour of
      the Puritans had produced in England. It <span class="pagenum">64</span><a
      name="link64" id="link64"></a>was the boast of Madame de Maintenon, in the
      time of her greatness, that devotion had become the fashion. A fashion
      indeed it was; and, like a fashion, it passed away. The austerity of the
      tyrant&rsquo;s old age had injured the morality of the higher orders more than
      even the licentiousness of his youth. Not only had he not reformed their
      vices, but, by forcing them to be hypocrites, he had shaken their belief
      in virtue. They had found it so easy to perform the grimace of piety, that
      it was natural for them to consider all piety as grimace. The times were
      changed. Pensions, regiments, and abbeys, were no longer to be obtained by
      regular confession and severe penance; and the obsequious courtiers, who
      had kept Lent like monks of La Trappe, and who had turned up the whites of
      their eyes at the edifying parts of sermons preached before the king,
      aspired to the title of <i>roué</i> as ardently as they had aspired to
      that of <i>dévot</i>; and went, during Passion Week, to the revels of the
      Palais Royal as readily as they had formerly repaired to the sermons of
      Massillon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Regent was in many respects the fac-simile of our Charles the Second.
      Like Charles, he was a good-natured man, utterly destitute of sensibility.
      Like Charles, he had good natural talents, which a deplorable indolence
      rendered useless to the state. Like Charles, he thought all men corrupt
      and interested, and yet did not dislike them for being so. His opinion of
      human nature was Gulliver&rsquo;s; but he did not regard human nature with
      Gulliver&rsquo;s horror. He thought that he and his fellow-creatures were
      Yahoos; and he thought a Yahoo a very agreeable kind of animal. No princes
      were ever more social than Charles and Philip of Orleans; yet no princes
      ever had less capacity for <span class="pagenum">65</span><a name="link65"
       id="link65"></a>friendship. The tempers of these clever cynics were so
      easy, and their minds so languid, that habit supplied in them the place of
      affection, and made them the tools of people for whom they cared not one
      straw. In love, both were mere sensualists without delicacy or tenderness.
      In politics, both were utterly careless of faith and of national honour.
      Charles shut up the Exchequer. Philip patronised the System. The councils
      of Charles were swayed by the gold of Barillon; the councils of Philip by
      the gold of Walpole. Charles for private objects made war on Holland, the
      natural ally of England. Philip for private objects made war on the
      Spanish branch of the house of Bourbon, the natural ally, indeed the
      creature, of France. Even in trifling circumstances the parallel might be
      carried on. Both these princes were fond of experimental philosophy, and
      passed in the laboratory much time which would have been more
      advantageously passed at the council-table. Both were more strongly
      attached to their female relatives than to any other human being; and in
      both cases it was suspected that this attachment was not perfectly
      innocent. In personal courage, and in all the virtues which are connected
      with personal courage, the Regent was indisputably superior to Charles.
      Indeed Charles but narrowly escaped the stain of cowardice. Philip was
      eminently brave, and, like most brave men, was generally open and sincere.
      Charles added dissimulation to his other vices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The administration of the Regent was scarcely less pernicious, and
      infinitely more scandalous, than that of the deceased monarch. It was by
      magnificent public works, and by wars conducted on a gigantic scale, that
      Louis had brought distress on his people. The Regent aggravated that
      distress by frauds of which a lame <span class="pagenum">66</span><a
      name="link66" id="link66"></a>duck on the stock-exchange would have been
      ashamed. France, even while suffering under the most severe calamities,
      had reverenced the conqueror. She despised the swindler.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Orleans and the wretched Dubois had disappeared, the power passed to
      the Duke of Bourbon; a prince degraded in the public eye by the infamously
      lucrative part which he had taken in the juggles of the System, and by the
      humility with which he bore the caprices of a loose and imperious woman.
      It seemed to be decreed that every branch of the royal family should
      successively incur the abhorrence and contempt of the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the fall of the Duke of Bourbon and the death of Fleury, a few
      years of frugal and moderate government intervened. Then recommenced the
      downward progress of the monarchy. Profligacy in the court, extravagance
      in the finances, schism in the church, faction in the Parliaments, unjust
      war terminated by ignominious peace,&mdash;all that indicates and all that
      produces the ruin of great empires, make up the history of that miserable
      period. Abroad, the French were beaten and humbled every where, by land
      and by sea, on the Elbe and on the Rhine, in Asia and in America. At home,
      they were turned over from vizier to vizier, and from sultana to sultana,
      till they had reached that point beneath which there was no lower abyss of
      infamy,&mdash;till the yoke of Maupeou had made them pine for Choiseul,&mdash;till
      Madame du Barri had taught them to regret Madame de Pompadour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, unpopular as the monarchy had become, the aristocracy was more
      unpopular still;&mdash;and not without reason. The tyranny of an
      individual is far more <span class="pagenum">67</span><a name="link67"
       id="link67"></a>supportable than the tyranny of a caste. The old
      privileges were galling and hateful to the new wealth and the new
      knowledge. Every thing indicated the approach of no common revolution,&mdash;of
      a revolution destined to change, not merely the form of government, but
      the distribution of property and the whole social system,&mdash;of a
      revolution the effects of which were to be felt at every fireside in
      France,&mdash;of a new Jaquerie, in which the victory was to remain with
      <i>Jaques bonhomme</i>. In the van of the movement were the moneyed men
      and the men of letters,&mdash;the wounded pride of wealth and the wounded
      pride of intellect. An immense multitude, made ignorant and cruel by
      oppression, was raging in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      We greatly doubt whether any course which could have been pursued by Louis
      the Sixteenth could have averted a great convulsion. But we are sure that,
      if there was such a course, it was the course recommended by M. Turgot.
      The church and the aristocracy, with that blindness to danger, that
      incapacity of believing that anything can be except what has been, which
      the long possession of power seldom fails to generate, mocked at the
      counsel which might have saved them. They would not have reform; and they
      had revolution. They would not pay a small contribution in place of the
      odious corvées; and they lived to see their castles demolished, and their
      lands sold to strangers. They would not endure Turgot; and they were
      forced to endure Robespierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the rulers of France, as if smitten with judicial blindness, plunged
      headlong into the American war. They thus committed at once two great
      errors. They encouraged the spirit of revolution. They augmented <span
      class="pagenum">68</span><a name="link68" id="link68"></a>at the same time
      those public burdens, the pressure of which is generally the immediate
      cause of revolutions. The event of the war carried to the height the
      enthusiasm of speculative democrats. The financial difficulties produced
      by the war carried to the height the discontent of that larger body of
      people who cared little about theories and much about taxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting of the States-General was the signal for the explosion of all
      the hoarded passions of a century. In that assembly, there were
      undoubtedly very able men. But they had no practical knowledge of the art
      of government. All the great English revolutions have been conducted by
      practical statesmen. The French Revolution was conducted by mere
      speculators. Our constitution has never been so far behind the age as to
      have become an object of aversion to the people. The English revolutions
      have therefore been undertaken for the purpose of defending, correcting,
      and restoring,&mdash;never for the mere purpose of destroying. Our
      countrymen have always, even in times of the greatest excitement, spoken
      reverently of the form of government under which they lived, and attacked
      only what they regarded as its corruptions. In the very act of innovating
      they have constantly appealed to ancient prescription; they have seldom
      looked abroad for models; they have seldom troubled themselves with
      Utopian theories; they have not been anxious to prove that liberty is a
      natural right of men; they have been content to regard it as the lawful
      birthright of Englishmen. Their social contract is no fiction. It is still
      extant on the original parchment, sealed with wax which was affixed at
      Runnymede, and attested by the lordly names of the Marischals and
      Fitzherberts. No general arguments about the original equality of men, no
      fine <span class="pagenum">69</span><a name="link69" id="link69"></a>stories
      out of Plutarch and Cornelius Nepos, have ever affected them so much as
      their own familiar words,&mdash;Magna Charta,&mdash;Habeas Corpus,&mdash;Trial
      by Jury,&mdash;Bill of Rights. This part of our national character has
      undoubtedly its disadvantages. An Englishman too often reasons on politics
      in the spirit rather of a lawyer than of a philosopher. There is too often
      something narrow, something exclusive, something Jewish, if we may use the
      word, in his love of freedom. He is disposed to consider popular rights as
      the special heritage of the chosen race to which he belongs. He is
      inclined rather to repel than to encourage the alien proselyte who aspires
      to a share of his privileges. Very different was the spirit of the
      Constituent Assembly. They had none of our narrowness; but they had none
      of our practical skill in the management of affairs. They did not
      understand how to regulate the order of their own debates; and they
      thought themselves able to legislate for the whole world. All the past was
      loathsome to them. All their agreeable associations were connected with
      the future. Hopes were to them all that recollections are to us. In the
      institutions of their country they found nothing to love or to admire. As
      far back as they could look, they saw only the tyranny of one class and
      the degradation of another,&mdash;Frank and Gaul, knight and villein,
      gentleman and <i>roturier</i>. They hated the monarchy, the church, the
      nobility. They cared nothing for the States or the Parliament. It was long
      the fashion to ascribe all the follies which they committed to the
      writings of the philosophers. We believe that it was misrule, and nothing
      but misrule, that put the sting into those writings. It is not time that
      the French abandoned experience for theories. They took up with theories
      because <span class="pagenum">70</span><a name="link70" id="link70"></a>they
      had no experience of good government. It was because they had no charter
      that they ranted about the original contract. As soon as tolerable
      institutions were given to them, they began to look to those institutions.
      In 1830 their rallying cry was <i>Vive la Charte</i>. In 1789 they had
      nothing but theories round which to rally. They had seen social
      distinctions only in a bad form; and it was therefore natural that they
      should be deluded by sophisms about the equality of men. They had
      experienced so much evil from the sovereignty of kings that they might be
      excused for lending a ready ear to those who preached, in an exaggerated
      form, the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English, content with their own national recollections and names, have
      never sought for models in the institutions of Greece or Rome. The French,
      having nothing in their own history to which they could look back with
      pleasure, had recourse to the history of the great ancient commonwealths:
      they drew their notions of those commonwealths, not from contemporary
      writers, but from romances written by pedantic moralists long after the
      extinction of public liberty. They neglected Thucydides for Plutarch.
      Blind themselves, they took blind guides. They had no experience of
      freedom; and they took their opinions concerning it from men who had no
      more experience of it than themselves, and whose imaginations, inflamed by
      mystery and privation, exaggerated the unknown enjoyment;&mdash;from men
      who raved about patriotism without having ever had a country, and
      eulogised tyrannicide while crouching before tyrants. The maxim which the
      French legislators learned in this school was, that political liberty is
      an end, and not a means; that it is not merely valuable as the great
      safe-guard of order, of property, <span class="pagenum">71</span><a
      name="link71" id="link71"></a>and of morality, but that it is in itself a
      high and exquisite happiness to which order, property, and morality ought
      without one scruple to be sacrificed. The lessons which may be learned
      from ancient history are indeed most useful and important; but they were
      not likely to be learned by men who, in all their rhapsodies about the
      Athenian democracy, seemed utterly to forget that in that democracy there
      were ten slaves to one citizen; and who constantly decorated their
      invectives against the aristocrats with panegyrics on Brutus and Cato,&mdash;two
      aristocrats, fiercer, prouder, and more exclusive, than any that emigrated
      with the Count of Artois.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have never met with so vivid and interesting a picture of the National
      Assembly as that which M. Dumont has set before us. His Mirabeau, in
      particular, is incomparable. All the former Mirabeaus were daubs in
      comparison. Some were merely painted from the imagination&mdash;others
      were gross caricatures: this is the very individual, neither god nor
      demon, but a man&mdash;a Frenchman,&mdash;a Frenchman of the eighteenth
      century, with great talents, with strong passions, depraved by bad
      education, surrounded by temptations of every kind,&mdash;made desperate
      at one time by disgrace, and then again intoxicated by fame. All his
      opposite and seemingly inconsistent qualities are in this representation
      so blended together as to make up a harmonious and natural whole. Till
      now, Mirabeau was to us, and, we believe, to most readers of history, not
      a man, but a string of antitheses. Henceforth he will be a real human
      being, a remarkable and eccentric being indeed, but perfectly conceivable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was fond, M. Dumont tells us, of giving odd compound nicknames. Thus,
      M. de Lafayette was <span class="pagenum">72</span><a name="link72"
       id="link72"></a>Grandison-Cromwell; the king of Prussia was Alaric-Cottin;
      D&rsquo;Espremenil was Crispin-Catiline. We think that Mirabeau himself might be
      described, after his own fashion, as a Wilkes-Chatham. He had Wilkes&rsquo;s
      sensuality, Wilkes&rsquo;s levity, Wilkes&rsquo;s insensibility to shame. Like Wilkes,
      he had brought on himself the censure even of men of pleasure by the
      peculiar grossness of his immorality, and by the obscenity of his
      writings. Like Wilkes, he was heedless, not only of the laws of morality,
      but of the laws of honour. Yet he affected, like Wilkes, to unite the
      character of the demagogue to that of the fine gentleman. Like Wilkes, he
      conciliated, by his good humour and his high spirits, the regard of many
      who despised his character. Like Wilkes, he was hideously ugly; like
      Wilkes, he made a jest of his own ugliness; and, like Wilkes, he was, in
      spite of his ugliness, very attentive to his dress, and very successful in
      affairs of gallantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resembling Wilkes in the lower and grosser parts of his character, he had,
      in his higher qualities, some affinity to Chatham. His eloquence, as far
      as we can judge of it, bore no inconsiderable resemblance to that of the
      great English minister. He was not eminently successful in long set
      speeches. He was not, on the other hand, a close and ready debater. Sudden
      bursts, which seemed to be the effect of inspiration&mdash;short sentences
      which came like lightning, dazzling, burning, striking down every thing
      before them&mdash;sentences which, spoken at critical moments, decided the
      fate of great questions&mdash;sentences which at once became proverbs&mdash;sentences
      which everybody still knows by heart&mdash;in these chiefly lay the
      oratorical power both of Chatham and of Mirabeau. There have been far
      greater speakers, and far greater statesmen, than either <span
      class="pagenum">73</span><a name="link73" id="link73"></a>of them; but we
      doubt whether any men have, in modern times, exercised such vast personal
      influence over stormy and divided assemblies. The power of both was as
      much moral as intellectual. In true dignity of character, in private and
      public virtue, it may seem absurd to institute any comparison between
      them; but they had the same haughtiness and vehemence of temper. In their
      language and manner there was a disdainful self-confidence, an
      imperiousness, a fierceness of passion, before which all common minds
      quailed. Even Murray and Charles Townshend, though intellectually not
      inferior to Chatham, were always cowed by him. Barnave, in the same
      manner, though the best debater in the National Assembly, flinched before
      the energy of Mirabeau. Men, except in bad novels, are not all good or all
      evil. It can scarcely be denied that the virtue of Lord Chatham was a
      little theatrical. On the other hand there was in Mirabeau, not indeed any
      thing deserving the name of virtue, but that imperfect substitute for
      virtue which is found in almost all superior minds,&mdash;a sensibility to
      the beautiful and the good, which sometimes amounted to sincere
      enthusiasm; and which, mingled with the desire of admiration, sometimes
      gave to his character a lustre resembling the lustre of true goodness,&mdash;as
      the &ldquo;faded splendour wan&rdquo; which lingered round the fallen archangel
      resembled the exceeding brightness of those spirits who had kept their
      first estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several other admirable portraits of eminent men in these
      Memoirs. That of Sieyes in particular, and that of Talleyrand, are
      masterpieces, full of life and expression. But nothing in the book has
      interested us more than the view which M. Dumont has presented to us,
      unostentatiously, and, we <span class="pagenum">74</span><a name="link74"
       id="link74"></a>may say, unconsciously, of his own character. The sturdy
      rectitude, the large charity, the good-nature, the modesty, the
      independent spirit, the ardent philanthropy, the unaffected indifference
      to money and to fame, make up a character which, while it has nothing
      unnatural, seems to us to approach nearer to perfection than any of the
      Grandisons and Allworthys of fiction. The work is not indeed precisely
      such a work as we had anticipated&mdash;it is more lively, more
      picturesque, more amusing than we had promised ourselves; and it is, on
      the other hand, less profound and philosophic. But, if it is not, in all
      respects, such as might have been expected from the intellect of M.
      Dumont, it is assuredly such as might have been expected from his heart.

      WAR OF THE SUCCESSION IN SPAIN. (1)

      Miscellanies in Prose and Verse by a Person of Honour, and Romances of M.
      Scuderi, done into English by a Person of Quality, were attractive to
      readers and profitable to booksellers, have long gone by. The literary
      privileges once enjoyed by lords are as obsolete as their right to kill
      the King&rsquo;s deer on their way to Parliament, or as their old remedy of <i>scandalum
      magnatum</i>. Yet we must acknowledge that, though our political opinions
      are by no means aristocratical, we always feel kindly disposed towards
      noble authors. Industry and a taste for intellectual pleasures are
      peculiarly respectable in those who can afford to be idle and who have
      every temptation to be dissipated. It is impossible not to wish success to
      a man who, finding himself placed, without any exertion or any merit on
      his part, above the mass of society, voluntarily descends from his
      eminence in search of distinctions which he may justly call his own.

      This is, we think, the second appearance of Lord Mahon in the character of
      an author. His first book was creditable to him, but was in every respect
      inferior to the work which now lies before us. He has

     (1) <i>History of the War of the Succession in Spain</i>. By Lord
     Mahon. 8vo London: 1832.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">76</span><a name="link76" id="link76"></a>undoubtedly
      some of the most valuable qualities of a historian, great diligence in
      examining authorities, great judgment in weighing testimony, and great
      impartiality in estimating characters. We are not aware that he has in any
      instance forgotten the duties belonging to his literary functions in the
      feelings of a kinsman. He does no more than justice to his ancestor
      Stanhope; he does full justice to Stanhope&rsquo;s enemies and rivals. His
      narrative is very perspicuous, and is also entitled to the praise, seldom,
      we grieve to say, deserved by modern writers, of being very concise. It
      must be admitted, however, that, with many of the best qualities of a
      literary veteran, he has some of the faults of a literary novice. He has
      not yet acquired a great command of words. His style is seldom easy, and
      is now and then unpleasantly stiff. He is so bigoted a purist that he
      transforms the Abbé d&rsquo;Estrées into an Abbot. We do not like to see French
      words introduced into English composition; but, after all, the first law
      of writing, that law to which all other laws are subordinate, is this,
      that the words employed shall be such as convey to the reader the meaning
      of the writer. Now an Abbot is the head of a religious house; an Abbé is
      quite a different sort of person. It is better undoubtedly to use an
      English word than a French word: but it is better to use a French word
      than to misuse an English word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mahon is also a little too fond of uttering moral reflections in a
      style too sententious and oracular. We will give one instance: &ldquo;Strange as
      it seems, experience shows that we usually feel far more animosity against
      those whom we have injured than against those who injure us: and this
      remark holds good with every degree of intellect, with every class of
      fortune, <span class="pagenum">77</span><a name="link77" id="link77"></a>with
      a prince or a peasant, a stripling or an elder, a hero or a prince.&rdquo; This
      remark might have seemed strange at the court of Nimrod or Chedorlaomer;
      but it has now been for many generations considered as a truism rather
      than a paradox. Every boy has written on the thesis &ldquo;<i>Odisse quem
      laeseris</i>.&rdquo; Scarcely any lines in English Poetry are better known than
      that vigorous couplet, <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"Forgiveness to
      the injured does belong; <br /><span class="indent15">But they ne&rsquo;er pardon
      who have done the wrong.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The historians and philosophers have quite done with this maxim, and have
      abandoned it, like other maxims which have lost their gloss, to bad
      novelists, by whom it will very soon be worn to rags.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no more than justice to say that the faults of Lord Mahon&rsquo;s book are
      precisely the faults which time seldom fails to cure, and that the book,
      in spite of those faults, is a valuable addition to our historical
      literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whoever wishes to be well acquainted with the morbid anatomy of
      governments, whoever wishes to know how great states may be made feeble
      and wretched, should study the history of Spain. The empire of Philip the
      Second was undoubtedly one of the most powerful and splendid that ever
      existed in the world. In Europe, he ruled Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands
      on both sides of the Rhine, Franche Comte, Roussillon, the Milanese, and
      the Two Sicilies. Tuscany, Parma, and the other small states of Italy,
      were as completely dependent on him as the Nizam and the Rajah of Berar
      now are on the East India Company. In Asia, the King of Spain was master
      of the Philippines and of all those rich settlements which the Portuguese
      had made on the coasts of Malabar and Coromandel, in the <span
      class="pagenum">78</span><a name="link78" id="link78"></a>Peninsula of
      Malacca, and in the spice-islands of the Eastern Archipelago. In America,
      his dominions extended on each side of the equator into the temperate
      zone. There is reason to believe that his annual revenue amounted, in the
      season of his greatest power, to a sum near ten times as large as that
      which England yielded to Elizabeth. He had a standing army of fifty
      thousand excellent troops, at a time when England had not a single
      battalion in constant pay. His ordinary naval force consisted of a hundred
      and forty galleys. He held, what no other prince in modern times has held,
      the dominion both of the land and of the sea. During the greater part of
      his reign, he was supreme on both elements. His soldiers marched up to the
      capital of France; his ships menaced the shores of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no exaggeration to say that, during several years, his power over
      Europe was greater than even that of Napoleon. The influence of the French
      conqueror never extended beyond low-water mark. The narrowest strait was
      to his power what it was of old believed that a running stream was to the
      sorceries of a witch. While his army entered every metropolis from Moscow
      to Lisbon, the English fleets blockaded every port from Dantzic to
      Trieste. Sicily, Sardinia, Majorca, Guernsey, enjoyed security through the
      whole course of a war which endangered every throne on the Continent. The
      victorious and imperial nation which had filled its museums with the
      spoils of Antwerp, of Florence, and of Rome, was suffering painfully from
      the want of luxuries which use had made necessaries. While pillars and
      arches were rising to commemorate the French conquests, the conquerors
      were trying to manufacture coffee out of succory and sugar out of
      beet-root. The influence of Philip on the Continent <span class="pagenum">79</span><a
      name="link79" id="link79"></a>was as great as that of Napoleon. The
      Emperor of Germany was his kinsman. France, torn by religious dissensions,
      was never a formidable opponent, and was sometimes a dependent ally. At
      the same time, Spain had what Napoleon desired in vain, ships, colonies,
      and commerce. She long monopolised the trade of America and of the Indian
      Ocean. All the gold of the West, and all the spices of the East, were
      received and distributed by her. During many years of war, her commerce
      was interrupted only by the predatory enterprises of a few roving
      privateers. Even after the defeat of the Armada, English statesmen
      continued to look with great dread on the maritime power of Philip. &ldquo;The
      King of Spain,&rdquo; said the Lord Keeper to the two Houses in 1593, &ldquo;since he
      hath usurped upon the kingdom of Portugal, hath thereby grown mighty by
      chaining the East Indies: so as, how great soever he was before, he is now
      thereby manifestly more great:.... He keepeth a navy armed to impeach all
      trade of merchandise from England to Gascoigne and Guienne, which he
      attempted to do this last vintage; so as he is now become as a frontier
      enemy to all the west of England, as well as all the south parts, as
      Sussex, Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight. Yea, by means of his interest in
      St. Maloes, a port full of shipping for the war, he is a dangerous
      neighbour to the Queen&rsquo;s isles of Jersey and Guernsey, ancient possessions
      of this crown, and never conquered in the greatest wars with France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ascendency which Spain then had in Europe was, in one sense, well
      deserved. It was an ascendency which had been gained by unquestioned
      superiority in all the arts of policy and of war. In the sixteenth
      century, Italy was not more decidedly the land <span class="pagenum">80</span><a
      name="link80" id="link80"></a>of the fine arts, Germany was not more
      decidedly the land of bold theological speculation, than Spain was the
      land of statesmen and of soldiers. The character which Virgil has ascribed
      to his countrymen might have been claimed by the grave and haughty chiefs,
      who surrounded the throne of Ferdinand the Catholic, and of his immediate
      successors. That majestic art, &ldquo;regere imperio populos,&rdquo; was not better
      understood by the Romans in the proudest days of their republic, than by
      Gonsalvo and Ximenes, Cortez and Alva. The skill of the Spanish
      diplomatists was renowned throughout Europe. In England the name of
      Gondomar is still remembered. The sovereign nation was unrivalled both in
      regular and irregular warfare. The impetuous chivalry of France, the
      serried phalanx of Switzerland, were alike found wanting when brought face
      to face with the Spanish infantry. In the wars of the New World, where
      something different from ordinary strategy was required in the general and
      something different from ordinary discipline in the soldier, where it was
      every day necessary to meet by some new expedient the varying tactics of a
      barbarous enemy, the Spanish adventurers, sprung from the common people,
      displayed a fertility of resource, and a talent for negotiation and
      command, to which history scarcely affords a parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Castilian of those times was to the Italian what the Roman, in the
      days of the greatness of Rome, was to the Greek. The conqueror had less
      ingenuity, less taste, less delicacy of perception than the conquered; but
      far more pride, firmness, and courage, a more solemn demeanour, a stronger
      sense of honour. The subject had more subtlety in speculation, the ruler
      more energy in action. The vices of the former were those of a <span
      class="pagenum">81</span><a name="link81" id="link81"></a>coward; the
      vices of the latter were those of a tyrant. It may be added, that the
      Spaniard, like the Roman, did not disdain to study the arts and the
      language of those whom he oppressed. A revolution took place in the
      literature of Spain, not unlike that revolution which, as Horace tells us,
      took place in the poetry of Latium: &ldquo;Capta ferum victorem cepit.&rdquo; The
      slave took prisoner the enslaver. The old Castilian ballads gave place to
      sonnets in the style of Petrarch, and to heroic poems in the stanza of
      Ariosto, as the national songs of Rome were driven out by imitations of
      Theocritus, and translations from Menander.
    </p>
    <p>
      In no modern society, not even in England during the reign of Elizabeth,
      has there been so great a number of men eminent at once in literature and
      in the pursuits of active life, as Spain produced during the sixteenth
      century. Almost every distinguished writer was also distinguished as a
      soldier and a politician, Boscan bore arms with high reputation. Garcilaso
      de Vega, the author of the sweetest and most graceful pastoral poem of
      modern times, after a short but splendid military career, fell sword in
      hand at the head of a storming party. Alonzo de Ercilla bore a conspicuous
      part in that war of Arauco, which he afterwards celebrated in one of the
      best heroic poems that Spain has produced. Hurtado de Mendoza, whose poems
      have been compared to those of Horace, and whose charming little novel is
      evidently the model of Gil Bias, has been handed down to us by history as
      one of the sternest of those iron pro-consuls who were employed by the
      House of Austria to crush the lingering public spirit of Italy. Lope
      sailed in the Armada; Cervantes was wounded at Lepanto.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is curious to consider with how much awe our ancestors <span
      class="pagenum">82</span><a name="link82" id="link82"></a>in those times
      regarded a Spaniard. He was, in their apprehension, a kind of dæmon,
      horribly malevolent, but withal most sagacious and powerful. &ldquo;They be
      verye wyse and politicke,&rdquo; says an honest Englishman, in a memorial
      addressed to Mary, &ldquo;and can, thorowe ther wysdome, reform and brydell
      theyr owne natures for a tyme, and applye their conditions to the maners
      of those men with whom they meddell gladlye by friendshippe; whose
      mischievous maners a man shall never knowe untyll he come under ther
      subjection: but then shall he parfectlye parceyve and fele them: which
      thynge I praye God England never do: for in dissimulations untyll they
      have ther purposes, and afterwards in oppression and tyrannye, when they
      can obtayne them, they do exceed all other nations upon the earthe.&rdquo; This
      is just such language as Anninius would have used about the Romans, or as
      an Indian statesman of our times might use about the English. It is the
      language of a man burning with hatred, but cowed by those whom he hates;
      and painfully sensible of their superiority, not only in power, but in
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How
      art thou cut down to the ground, that didst weaken the nations! If we
      overleap a hundred years, and look at Spain towards the close of the
      seventeenth centnry, what a change do we find! The contrast is as great as
      that which the Rome of Gallienus and Honorius presents to the Rome of
      Marins and Caesar. Foreign conquest had begun to eat into every part of
      that gigantic monarchy on which the sun never set. Holland was gone, and
      Portugal, and Artois, and Roussillon, and Franche Comté. In the East, the
      empire founded by the Dutch far surpassed <span class="pagenum">83</span><a
      name="link83" id="link83"></a>in wealth and splendour that which their old
      tyrants still retained. In the West, England had seized, and still held,
      settlements in the midst of the Mexican sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mere loss of territory was, however, of little moment. The reluctant
      obedience of distant provinces generally costs more than it is worth.
      Empires which branch out widely are often more flourishing for a little
      timely pruning. Adrian acted judiciously when he abandoned the conquests
      of Trajan; and England was never so rich, so great, so formidable to
      foreign princes, so absolutely mistress of the sea, as since the loss of
      her American colonies. The Spanish empire was still, in outward
      appearance, great and magnificent. The European dominions subject to the
      last feeble Prince of the House of Austria were far more extensive than
      those of Lewis the Fourteenth. The American dependencies of the Castilian
      crown still extended far to the North of Cancer and far to the South of
      Capricorn. But within this immense body there was an incurable decay, an
      utter want of tone, an utter prostration of strength. An ingenious and
      diligent population, eminently skilled in arts and manufactures, had been
      driven into exile by stupid and remorseless bigots. The glory of the
      Spanish pencil had departed with Velasquez and Murillo. The splendid age
      of Spanish literature had closed with Solis and Calderon. During the
      seventeenth century many states had formed great military establishments.
      But the Spanish army, so formidable under the command of Alva and Farnese,
      had dwindled away to a few thousand men, ill paid and ill disciplined.
      England, Holland, and France had great navies. But the Spanish navy was
      scarcely equal to the tenth part of that mighty force which, in <span
      class="pagenum">84</span><a name="link84" id="link84"></a>the time of
      Philip the Second, had been the terror of the Atlantic and the
      Mediterranean. The arsenals were deserted. The magazines were unprovided.
      The frontier fortresses were ungarrisoned. The police was utterly
      inefficient for the protection of the people. Murders were committed in
      the face of day with perfect impunity. Bravoes and discarded serving-men,
      with swords at their sides, swaggered every day through the most public
      streets and squares of the capital, disturbing the public peace, and
      setting at defiance the ministers of justice. The finances were in
      frightful disorder. The people paid much. The government received little.
      The American viceroys and the farmers of the revenue became rich, while
      the merchants broke, while the peasantry starved while the body-servants
      of the sovereign remained unpaid, while the soldiers of the royal guard
      repaired daily to the doors of convents, and battled there with the crowd
      of beggars for a porringer of broth and a morsel of bread. Every remedy
      which was tried aggravated the disease. The currency was altered; and this
      frantic measure produced its never-failing effects. It destroyed all
      credit, and increased the misery which it was intended to relieve. The
      American gold, to use the words of Ortiz, was to the necessities of the
      state but as a drop of water to the lips of a man raging with thirst.
      Heaps of unopened despatches accumulated in the offices, while the
      Ministers were concerting with bedchamber-women and Jesuits the means of
      tripping up each other. Every foreign power could plunder and insult with
      impunity the heir of Charles the Fifth. Into such a state had the mighty
      kingdom of Spain fallen, while one of its smallest dependencies, a country
      not so large as the province of Estremadura or Andalusia, situated under
      <span class="pagenum">85</span><a name="link85" id="link85"></a>an
      inclement sky, and preserved only by artificial means from the inroads of
      the ocean, had become a power of the first class, and treated on terms of
      equality with the courts of London and Versailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner in which Lord Mahon explains the financial situation of Spain
      by no means satisfies us. &ldquo;It will be found,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that those
      individuals deriving their chief income from mines, whose yearly produce
      is uncertain and varying, and seems rather to spring from fortune than to
      follow industry, are usually careless, unthrifty, and irregular in their
      expenditure. The example of Spain might tempt us to apply the same remark
      to states.&rdquo; Lord Mahon would find it difficult, we suspect, to make out
      his analogy. Nothing could be more uncertain and varying than the gains
      and losses of those who were in the habit of putting into the state
      lotteries. But no part of the public income was more certain than that
      which was derived from the lotteries. We believe that this case is very
      similar to that of the American mines. Some veins of ore exceeded
      expectation; some fell below it. Some of the private speculators drew
      blanks, and others gained prizes. But the revenue of the state depended,
      not on any particular vein, but on the whole annual produce of two great
      continents. This annual produce seems to have been almost constantly on
      the increase during the seventeenth century. The Mexican mines were,
      through the reigns of Philip the Fourth and Charles the Second, in a
      steady course of improvement; and in South America, though the district of
      Potosi was not so productive as formerly, other places more than made up
      for the deficiency. We very much doubt whether Lord Mahon can prove that
      the income which the Spanish government derived from the mines <span
      class="pagenum">86</span><a name="link86" id="link86"></a>of America
      fluctuated more than the income derived from the internal taxes of Spain
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the causes of the decay of Spain resolve themselves into one cause,
      bad government. The valour, the intelligence, the energy which, at the
      close of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth century, had
      made the Spaniards the first nation in the world, were the fruits of the
      old institutions of Castile and Arragon, institutions eminently favourable
      to public liberty. Those institutions the first Princes of the House of
      Austria attacked and almost wholly destroyed. Their successors expiated
      the crime. The effects of a change from good government to bad government
      is not fully felt for some time after the change has taken place. The
      talents and the virtues which a good constitution generates may for a time
      survive that constitution. Thus the reigns of princes who have established
      absolute monarchy on the ruins of popular forms of government often shine
      in history with a peculiar brilliancy. But when a generation or two has
      passed away, then comes signally to pass that which was written by
      Montesquieu, that despotic governments resemble those savages who cut down
      the tree in order to get at the fruit. During the first years of tyranny,
      is reaped the harvest sown during the last years of liberty. Thus the
      Augustan age was rich in great minds formed in the generation of Cicero
      and Caesar. The fruits of the policy of Augustus were reserved for
      posterity. Philip the Second was the heir of the Cortez and of the Justiza
      Mayor; and they left him a nation which seemed able to conquer all the
      world. What Philip left to his successors is well known.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock which the great religious schism of the sixteenth century gave
      to Europe, was scarcely felt <span class="pagenum">87</span><a
      name="link87" id="link87"></a>in Spain. In England, Germany, Holland,
      France, Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden, that shock had produced, with some
      temporary evil, much durable good. The principles of the Reformation had
      triumphed in some of those countries. The Catholic Church had maintained
      its ascendency in others. But though the event had not been the same in
      all, all had been agitated by the conflict. Even in France, in Southern
      Germany, and in the Catholic cantons of Switzerland, the public mind had
      been stirred to its inmost depths. The hold of ancient prejudice had been
      somewhat loosened. The Church of Rome, warned by the danger which she had
      narrowly escaped, had, in those parts of her dominion, assumed a milder
      and more liberal character. She sometimes condescended to submit her high
      pretensions to the scrutiny of reason, and availed herself more sparingly
      than in former times of the aid of the secular arm. Even when persecution
      was employed, it was not persecution in the worst and most frightful
      shape. The severities of Lewis the Fourteenth, odious as they were, cannot
      be compared with those which, at the first dawn of the Reformation, had
      been inflicted on the heretics in many parts of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only effect which the Reformation had produced in Spain had been to
      make the Inquisition more vigilant and the commonalty more bigoted. The
      times of refreshing came to all neighboring; countries. One people alone
      remained, like the fleece of the Hebrew warrior, dry in the midst of that
      benignant and fertilising dew. While other nations were putting away
      childish things, the Spaniard still thought as a child and understood as a
      child. Among the men of the seventeenth century, he was the man of the
      fifteenth <span class="pagenum">88</span><a name="link88" id="link88"></a>century
      or of a still darker period, delighted to behold an <i>Auto da fe</i>, and
      ready to volunteer on a Crusade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evils produced by a bad government and a bad religion, seemed to have
      attained their greatest height during the last years of the seventeenth
      century. While the kingdom was in this deplorable state, the King,
      Charles, second of the name, was hastening to an early grave. His days had
      been few and evil. He had been unfortunate in all his wars, in every part
      of his internal administration, and in all his domestic relations. His
      first wife, whom he tenderly loved, died very young. His second wife
      exercised great influence over him, but seems to have been regarded by him
      rather with fear than with love. He was childless; and his constitution
      was so completely shattered that, at little more than thirty years of age,
      he had given up all hopes of posterity. His mind was even more distempered
      than his body. He was sometimes sunk in listless melancholy, and sometimes
      harassed by the wildest and most extravagant fancies. He was not, however,
      wholly destitute of the feelings which became his station. His sufferings
      were aggravated by the thought that his own dissolution might not
      improbably be followed by the dissolution of his empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several princes laid claim to the succession. The King&rsquo;s eldest sister had
      married Lewis the Fourteenth. The Dauphin would, therefore, in the common
      course of inheritance, have succeeded to the crown. But the Infanta had,
      at the time of her espousals, solemnly renounced, in her own name, and in
      that of her posterity, all claim to the succession. This renunciation had
      been confirmed in due form by the Cortes. A younger sister of the King had
      been the first wife of <span class="pagenum">89</span><a name="link89"
       id="link89"></a>Leopold, Emperor of Germany. She too had at her marriage
      renounced her claims to the Spanish crown; but the Cortes had not
      sanctioned the renunciation, and it was therefore considered as invalid by
      the Spanish jurists. The fruit of this marriage was a daughter, who had
      espoused the Elector of Bavaria. The Electoral Prince of Bavaria inherited
      her claim to the throne of Spain. The Emperor Leopold was son of a
      daughter of Philip the Third, and was therefore first cousin to Charles.
      No renunciation whatever had been exacted from his mother at the time of
      her marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was certainly very complicated. That claim which, according
      to the ordinary rules of inheritance, was the strongest, had been barred
      by a contract executed in the most binding form. The claim of the
      Electoral Prince of Bavaria was weaker. But so also was the contract which
      bound him not to prosecute his claim. The only party against whom no
      instrument of renunciation could be produced was the party who, in respect
      of blood, had the weakest claim of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was clear that great alarm would be excited throughout Europe if
      either the Emperor or the Dauphin should become King of Spain, each of
      those Princes offered to waive his pretensions in favour of his second
      son; the Emperor, in favour of the Archduke Charles, the Dauphin, in
      favour of Philip Duke of Anjou.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the peace of Ryswick, William the Third and Lewis the
      Fourteenth determined to settle the question of the succession without
      consulting either Charles or the Emperor. France, England, and Holland,
      became parties to a treaty by which it was stipulated <span class="pagenum">90</span><a
      name="link90" id="link90"></a>that the Electoral Prince of Bavaria should
      succeed to Spain, the Indies, and the Netherlands. The Imperial family
      were to be bought off with the Milanese; and the Dauphin was to have the
      Two Sicilies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great object of the King of Spain and of all his counsellors was to
      avert the dismemberment of the monarchy. In the hope of attaining this
      end, Charles determined to name a successor. A will was accordingly framed
      by which the crown was bequeathed to the Bavarian Prince. Unhappily, this
      will had scarcely been signed when the Prince died. The question was again
      unsettled, and presented greater difficulties than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new Treaty of Partition was concluded between France, England, and
      Holland. It was agreed that Spain, the Indies, and the Netherlands, should
      descend to the Archduke Charles. In return for this great concession made
      by the Bourbons to a rival house, it was agreed that France should have
      the Milanese, or an equivalent in a more commodious situation. The
      equivalent in view was the province of Lorraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arbuthnot, some years later, ridiculed the Partition Treaty with exquisite
      humour and ingenuity. Everybody must remember his description of the
      paroxysm of rage into which poor old Lord Strutt fell, on hearing that his
      runaway servant Nick Frog, his clothier John Bull, and his old enemy Lewis
      Baboon, had come with quadrants, poles, and inkhorns, to survey his
      estate, and to draw his will for him. Lord Mahon speaks of the arrangement
      with grave severity. He calls it, &ldquo;an iniquitous compact, concluded
      without the slightest reference to the welfare of the states so readily
      parcelled and allotted; insulting to the pride of Spain, <span
      class="pagenum">91</span><a name="link91" id="link91"></a>and tending to
      strip that country of its hard-won conquests.&rdquo; The most serious part of
      this charge would apply to half the treaties which have been concluded in
      Europe quite as strongly as to the Partition Treaty. What regard was shown
      in the treaty of the Pyrenees to the welfare of the people of Dunkirk and
      Roussillon, in the treaty of Nimeguen to the welfare of the people of
      Franche Comte, in the treaty of Utrecht to the welfare of the people of
      Flanders, in the treaty of 1735 to the welfare of the people of Tuscany?
      All Europe remembers, and our latest posterity will, we fear, have reason
      to remember how coolly, at the last great pacification of Christendom, the
      people of Poland, of Norway, of Belgium, and of Lombardy, were allotted to
      masters whom they abhorred. The statesmen who negotiated the Partition
      Treaty were not so far beyond their age and ours in wisdom and virtue as
      to trouble themselves much about the happiness of the people whom they
      were apportioning among foreign rulers. But it will be difficult to prove
      that the stipulations which Lord Mahon condemns were in any respect
      unfavourable to the happiness of those who were to be transferred to new
      sovereigns. The Neapolitans would certainly have lost nothing by being
      given to the Dauphin, or to the Great Turk. Addison, who visited Naples
      about the time at which the Partition Treaty was signed, has left us a
      frightful description of the misgovernment under which that part of the
      Spanish Empire groaned. As to the people of Lorraine, an union with France
      would have been the happiest event which could have befallen them. Lewis
      was already their sovereign for all purposes of cruelty and exaction. He
      had kept their country during many years in his own hands. At the peace of
      Ryswick, indeed, their <span class="pagenum">92</span><a name="link92"
       id="link92"></a>Duke had been allowed to return. But the conditions which
      had been imposed on him made him a mere vassal of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot admit that the Treaty of Partition was objectionable because it
      &ldquo;tended to strip Spain of hard-won conquests.&rdquo; The inheritance was so
      vast, and the claimants so mighty, that without some dismemberment it was
      scarcely possible to make a peaceable arrangement. If any dismemberment
      was to take place, the best way of effecting it surely was to separate
      from the monarchy those provinces which were at a great distance from
      Spain, which were not Spanish in manners, in language, or in feelings,
      which were both worse governed and less valuable than the old kingdoms of
      Castile and Arragon, and which, having always been governed by foreigners,
      would not be likely to feel acutely the humiliation of being turned over
      from one master to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      That England and Holland had a right to interfere is plain. The question
      of the Spanish succession was not an internal question, but an European
      question. And this Lord Mahon admits. He thinks that when the evil had
      been done, and a French Prince was reigning at the Escurial, England and
      Holland were justified in attempting, not merely to strip Spain of its
      remote dependencies, but to conquer Spain itself; that they were justified
      in attempting to put, not merely the passive Flemings and Italians, but
      the reluctant Castilians and Asturians, under the dominion of a stranger.
      The danger against which the Partition Treaty was intended to guard was
      precisely the same danger which afterwards was made the ground of war. It
      will be difficult to prove that a danger which was sufficient to justify
      the war was insufficient <span class="pagenum">93</span><a name="link93"
       id="link93"></a>to justify the provisions of the treaty. If, as Lord Mahon
      contends, it was better that Spain should be subjugated by main force than
      that she should be governed by a Bourbon, it was surely better that she
      should be deprived of Sicily and the Milanese than that she should be
      governed by a Bourbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the treaty was judiciously framed is quite another question. We
      disapprove of the stipulations. But we disapprove of them, not because we
      think them bad, but because we think that there was no chance of their
      being executed. Lewis was the most faithless of politicians. He hated the
      Dutch. He hated the Government which the Revolution had established in
      England. He had every disposition to quarrel with his new allies. It was
      quite certain that he would not observe his engagements, if it should be
      for his interest to violate them. Even if it should be for his interest to
      observe them, it might well be doubted whether the strongest and clearest
      interest would induce a man so haughty and self-willed to cooperate
      heartily with two governments which had always been the objects of his
      scorn and aversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When intelligence of the second Partition Treaty arrived at Madrid, it
      roused to momentary energy the languishing ruler of a languishing state.
      The Spanish ambassador at the court of London was directed to remonstrate
      with the government ef William; and his remonstrances were so insolent
      that he was commanded to leave England. Charles retaliated by dismissing
      the English and Dutch ambassadors. The French King, though the chief
      author of the Partition Treaty, succeeded in turning the whole wrath of
      Charles and of the Spanish people from himself, and in directing it
      against the two maritime <span class="pagenum">94</span><a name="link94"
       id="link94"></a>powers. Those powers had now no agent at Madrid. Their
      perfidious ally was at liberty to carry on his intrigues unchecked; and he
      fully availed himself of this advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long contest was maintained with varying success by the factions which
      surrounded the miserable King. On the side of the Imperial family was the
      Queen, herself a Princess of that family. With her were allied the
      confessor of the King, and most of the ministers. On the other side were
      two of the most dexterous politicians of that age, Cardinal Porto Carrero,
      Archbishop of Toledo, and Harcourt the ambassador of Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt was a noble specimen of the French aristocracy in the days of its
      highest splendour, a finished gentleman, a brave soldier, and a skilful
      diplomatist. His courteous and insinuating manners, his Parisian vivacity
      tempered with Castilian gravity, made him the favourite of the whole
      court. He became intimate with the grandees. He caressed the clergy. He
      dazzled the multitude by his magnificent style of living. The prejudices
      which the people of Madrid conceived against the French character, the
      vindictive feelings generated during centuries of national rivalry,
      gradually yielded to his arts; while the Austrian ambassador, a surly,
      pompous, niggardly German, made himself and his country more and more
      unpopular every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt won over the court and the city: Porto Carrero managed the King.
      Never were knave and dupe better suited to each other. Charles was sick,
      nervous, and extravagantly superstitious. Porto Carrero had learned in the
      exercise of his profession the art of exciting and soothing such minds;
      and he <span class="pagenum">95</span><a name="link95" id="link95"></a>employed
      that art with the calm and demure cruelty which is the characteristic of
      wicked and ambitious priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      He first supplanted the confessor. The state of the poor King, during the
      conflict between his two spiritual advisers, was horrible. At one time he
      was induced to believe that his malady was the same with that of the
      wretches described in the New Testament, who dwelt among the tombs, whom
      no chains could bind, and whom no man dared to approach. At another time a
      sorceress who lived in the mountains of the Asturias was consulted about
      his malady. Several persons were accused of having bewitched him. Porto
      Carrero recommended the appalling rite of exorcism, which was actually
      performed. The ceremony made the poor King more nervous and miserable than
      ever. But it served the turn of the Cardinal who, after much secret
      trickery, succeeded in casting out, not the devil, but the confessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next object was to get rid of the Ministers. Madrid was supplied with
      provisions by a monopoly. The government looked after this most delicate
      concern as it looked after every thing else. The partisans of the House of
      Bourbon took advantage of the negligence of the administration. On a
      sudden the supply of food failed. Exorbitant prices were demanded. The
      people rose. The royal residence was surrounded by an immense multitude.
      The Queen harangued them. The priests exhibited the host. All was in vain.
      It was necessary to awaken the King from his uneasy sleep, and to carry
      him to the balcony. There a solemn promise was given that the unpopular
      advisers of the crown should be forthwith dismissed. The mob left the
      palace and proceeded to pull down <span class="pagenum">96</span><a
      name="link96" id="link96"></a>the houses of the ministers. The adherents
      of the Austrian line were thus driven from power, and the government was
      intrusted to the creatures of Porto Carrero. The King left the city in
      which he had suffered so cruel an insult for the magnificent retreat of
      the Escurial. Here his hypochondriac fancy took a new turn. Like his
      ancestor Charles the Fifth, he was haunted by a strange curiosity to pry
      into the secrets of that grave to which he was hastening. In the cemetery
      which Philip the Second had formed beneath the pavement of the church of
      St. Lawrence, reposed three generations of Castilian princes. Into these
      dark vaults the unhappy monarch descended by torch-light, and penetrated
      to that superb and gloomy chamber where, round the great black crucifix,
      were ranged the coffins of the kings and queens of Spain. There he
      commanded his attendants to open the massy chests of bronze in which the
      relics of his predecessors decayed. He looked on the ghastly spectacle
      with little emotion till the coffin of his first wife was unclosed, and
      she appeared before him&mdash;such was the skill of the embalmer&mdash;in
      all her well-remembered beauty. He cast one glance on those beloved
      features, unseen for eighteen years, those features over which corruption
      seemed to have no power, and rushed from the vault, exclaiming, &ldquo;She is
      with God; and I shall soon be with her.&rdquo; The awful sight completed the
      ruin of his body and mind. The Escurial became hateful to him; and he
      hastened to Aranjuez. But the shades and waters of that delicious
      island-garden, so fondly celebrated in the sparkling verse of Calderon,
      brought no solace to their unfortunate master. Having tried medicine,
      exercise, and amusement in vain, he returned to Madrid to die. <span
      class="pagenum">97</span><a name="link97" id="link97"></a>He was now beset
      on every side by the bold and skilful agents of the House of Bourbon. The
      leading politicians of his court assured him that Lewis, and Lewis alone,
      was sufficiently powerful to preserve the Spanish monarchy undivided, and
      that Austria would be utterly unable to prevent the Treaty of Partition
      from being carried into effect. Some celebrated lawyers gave it as their
      opinion that the act of renunciation executed by the late Queen of France
      ought to be construed according to the spirit, and not according to the
      letter. The letter undoubtedly excluded the French Princes. The spirit was
      merely this, that ample security should be taken against the union of the
      French and Spanish crowns on one head.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all probability, neither political nor legal reasonings would have
      sufficed to overcome the partiality which Charles felt for the House of
      Austria. There had always been a close connection between the two great
      royal lines which sprang from the marriage of Philip and Juana. Both had
      always regarded the French as their natural enemies. It was necessary to
      have recourse to religious terrors; and Porto Carrero employed those
      terrors with true professional skill. The King&rsquo;s life was drawing to a
      close. Would the most Catholic prince commit a great sin on the brink of
      the grave? And what could be a greater sin than, from an unreasonable
      attachment to a family name, from an unchristian antipathy to a rival
      house, to set aside the rightful heir of an immense monarchy? The tender
      conscience and the feeble intellect of Charles were strongly wrought upon
      by these appeals. At length Porto Carrero ventured on a master-stroke. He
      advised Charles to apply for counsel to the Pope. The King who, in the
      simplicity of his heart, considered <span class="pagenum">98</span><a
      name="link98" id="link98"></a>the successor of St. Peter as an infallible
      guide in spiritual matters, adopted the suggestion; and Porto Carrero, who
      knew that his Holiness was a mere tool of France, awaited with perfect
      confidence the result of the application. In the answer which arrived from
      Rome, the King was solemnly reminded of the great account which he was
      soon to render, and cautioned against the flagrant injustice which he was
      tempted to commit. He was assured that the right was with the House of
      Bourbon, and reminded that his own salvation ought to be dearer to him
      than the House of Austria. Yet he still continued irresolute. His
      attachment to his family, his aversion to France, were not to be overcome
      even by Papal authority. At length he thought himself actually dying. Then
      the cardinal redoubled his efforts. Divine after divine, well tutored for
      the occasion, was brought to the bed of the trembling penitent. He was
      dying in the commission of known sin. He was defrauding his relatives. He
      was bequeathing civil war to his people. He yielded, and signed that
      memorable Testament, the cause of many calamities to Europe. As he affixed
      his name to the instrument, he burst into tears. &ldquo;God,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;gives
      kingdoms and takes them away. I am already one of the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The will was kept secret during the short remainder of his life. On the
      third of November 1700 he expired. All Madrid crowded to the palace. The
      gates were thronged. The antechamber was filled with ambassadors and
      grandees, eager to learn what dispositions the deceased sovereign had
      made. At length the folding doors were flung open. The Duke of Abrantes
      came forth, and announced that the whole Spanish monarchy was bequeathed
      to Philip Duke of Anjou. <span class="pagenum">99</span><a name="link99"
       id="link99"></a>Charles had directed that, during the interval which might
      elapse between his death and the arrival of his successor, the government
      should be administered by a council, of which Porto Carrero was the chief
      member.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis acted, as the English ministers might have guessed that he would
      act. With scarcely the show of hesitation, he broke through all the
      obligations of the Partition Treaty, and accepted for his grandson the
      splendid legacy of Charles. The new sovereign hastened to take possession
      of his dominions. The whole court of France accompanied him to Sceaux. His
      brothers escorted him to that frontier which, as they weakly imagined, was
      to be a frontier no longer. &ldquo;The Pyrenees,&rdquo; said Lewis, &ldquo;have ceased to
      exist.&rdquo; Those very Pyrenees, a few years later, were the theatre of a war
      between the heir of Lewis and the prince whom France was now sending to
      govern Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Charles had ransacked Europe to find a successor whose moral and
      intellectual character resembled his own, he could not have chosen better.
      Philip was not so sickly as his predecessor, but he was quite as weak, as
      indolent, and as superstitious; he very soon became quite as
      hypochondriacal and eccentric; and he was even more uxorious. He was
      indeed a husband of ten thousand. His first object when he became King of
      Spain, was to procure a wife. From the day of his marriage to the day of
      her death, his first object was to have her near him, and to do what she
      wished. As soon as his wife died his first object was to procure another.
      Another was found as unlike the former as possible. But she was a wife;
      and Philip was content. Neither by day nor by night, neither in sickness
      nor in health, neither in time of business nor in time of relaxation, did
      he ever suffer her to be absent from him for <span class="pagenum">100</span><a
      name="link100" id="link100"></a>half an hour. His mind was naturally
      feeble; and he had received an enfeebling education; he had been brought
      up amidst the dull magnificence of Versailles. His grandfather was as
      imperious and as ostentatious in his intercourse with the royal family as
      in public acts. All those who grew up immediately under the eye of Lewis
      had the manners of persons who had never known what it was to be at ease.
      They were all taciturn, shy, and awkward. In all of them, except the Duke
      of Burgundy, the evil went further than the manners. The Dauphin, the Duke
      of Berri, Philip of Anjou, were men of insignificant characters. They had
      no energy, no force of will. They had been so little accustomed to judge
      or to act for themselves that implicit dependence had become necessary to
      their comfort. The new King of Spain, emancipated from control, resembled
      that wretched German captive who, when the irons which he had worn for
      years were knocked off, fell prostrate on the floor of his prison. The
      restraints which had enfeebled the mind of the young Prince were required
      to support it. Till he had a wife he could do nothing; and when he had a
      wife he did whatever she chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this lounging, moping boy was on his way to Madrid, his grandfather
      was all activity. Lewis had no reason to fear a contest with the Empire
      singlehanded. He made vigorous preparations to encounter Leopold. He
      overawed the States-General by means of a great army. He attempted to
      soothe the English government by fair professions. William was not
      deceived. He fully returned the hatred of Lewis and, if he had been free
      to act according to his own inclinations, he would have declared war as
      soon as the contents of the will were known. But he was bound <span
      class="pagenum">101</span><a name="link101" id="link101"></a>by
      constitutional restraints. Both his person and his measures were unpopular
      in England. His secluded life and his cold manners disgusted a people
      accustomed to the graceful affability of Charles the Second. His foreign
      accent and his foreign attachments were offensive to the national
      prejudices. His reign had been a season of distress, following a season of
      rapidly increasing prosperity. The burdens of the late war and the expense
      of restoring the currency had been severely felt. Nine clergymen out of
      ten were Jacobites at heart, and had sworn allegiance to the new dynasty,
      only in order to save their benefices. A large proportion of the country
      gentlemen belonged to the same party. The whole body of agricultural
      proprietors was hostile to that interest which the creation of the
      national debt had brought into notice, and which was believed to be
      peculiarly favoured by the Court, the monied interest. The middle classes
      were fully determined to keep out James and his family. But they regarded
      William only as the less of two evils; and as long as there was no
      imminent danger of a counter-revolution, were disposed to thwart and
      mortify the sovereign by whom they were, nevertheless, ready to stand, in
      case of necessity, with their lives and fortunes. They were sullen and
      dissatisfied. &ldquo;There was,&rdquo; as Somers expressed it in a remarkable letter
      to William, &ldquo;a deadness and want of spirit in the nation universally.&rdquo;
       Every thing in England was going on as Lewis could have wished. The
      leaders of the Whig party had retired from power, and were extremely
      unpopular on account of the unfortunate issue of the Partition Treaty. The
      Tories, some of whom still cast a lingering look towards St. Germain&rsquo;s,
      were in office, and had a decided majority in the House of Commons.
      William <span class="pagenum">102</span><a name="link102" id="link102"></a>was
      so much embarrassed by the state of parties in England that he could not
      venture to make war on the House of Bourbon. He was suffering under a
      complication of severe and incurable diseases. There was every reason to
      believe that a few months would dissolve the fragile tie which bound up
      that feeble body with that ardent and unconquerable soul. If Lewis could
      succeed in preserving peace for a short time, it was probable that all his
      vast designs would be securely accomplished. Just at this crisis, the most
      important crisis of his life, his pride and his passions hurried him into
      an error, which undid all that forty years of victory and intrigue had
      done, which produced the dismemberment of the kingdom of his grandson, and
      brought invasion, bankruptcy, and famine on his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      James the Second died at St. Germain&rsquo;s. Lewis paid him a farewell visit,
      and was so much moved by the solemn parting, and by the grief of the
      exiled queen, that, losing sight of all considerations of policy, and
      actuated, as it should seem, merely by compassion and by a not ungenerous
      vanity, he acknowledged the Prince of Wales as King of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      The indignation which the Castilians had felt when they heard that three
      foreign powers had undertaken to regulate the Spanish succession was
      nothing to the rage with which the English learned that their good
      neighbour had taken the trouble to provide them with a king. Whigs and
      Tories joined in condemning the proceedings of the French Court. The cry
      for war was raised by the city of London, and echoed and reechoed from
      every corner of the realm. William saw that his time was come. Though his
      wasted and suffering body could hardly move without support, his spirit
      was as energetic and resolute as when, <span class="pagenum">103</span><a
      name="link103" id="link103"></a>at twenty-three, he bade defiance to the
      combined forces of England and France. He left the Hague, where he had
      been engaged in negotiating with the States and the Emperor a defensive
      treaty against the ambitious designs of the Bourbons. He flew to London.
      He remodelled the ministry. He dissolved the Parliament. The majority of
      the new House of Commons was with the King; and the most vigorous
      preparations were made for war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the commencement of active hostilities William was no more. But the
      Grand Alliance of the European Princes against the Bourbons was already
      constructed. &ldquo;The master workman died,&rdquo; says Mr. Burke; &ldquo;but the work was
      formed on true mechanical principles, and it was as truly wrought.&rdquo; On the
      fifteenth of May, 1702, war was proclaimed by concert at Vienna, at
      London, and at the Hague.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus commenced that great struggle by which Europe, from the Vistula to
      the Atlantic Ocean, was agitated during twelve years. The two hostile
      coalitions were, in respect of territory, wealth, and population, not
      unequally matched. On the one side were France, Spain, and Bavaria; on the
      other England, Holland, the Empire, and a crowd of inferior Powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      That part of the war which Lord Mahon has undertaken to relate; though not
      the least important, is certainly the least attractive. In Italy, in
      Germany, and in the Netherlands, great means were at the disposal of great
      generals. Mighty battles were fought. Fortress after fortress was subdued.
      The iron chain of the Belgian strongholds was broken. By a regular and
      connected series of operations extending through several years, the French
      were driven back from the Danube and the Po into their own provinces. The
      <span class="pagenum">104</span><a name="link104" id="link104"></a>war in
      Spain, on the contrary, is made up of events which seem to have no
      dependence on each other. The turns of fortune resemble those which take
      place in a dream. Victory and defeat are not followed by their usual
      consequences. Armies spring out of nothing, and melt into nothing. Yet, to
      judicious readers of history, the Spanish conflict is perhaps more
      interesting than the campaigns of Marlborough and Eugene. The fate of the
      Milanese and of the Low Countries was decided by military skill. The fate
      of Spain was decided by the peculiarities of the national character.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the war commenced, the young King was in a most deplorable situation.
      On his arrival at Madrid he found Porto Carrero at the head of affairs,
      and he did not think fit to displace the man to whom he owed his crown.
      The cardinal was a mere intriguer, and in no sense a statesman. He had
      acquired, in the Court and in the Confessional, a rare degree of skill in
      all the tricks by which weak minds are managed. But of the noble science
      of government, of the sources of national prosperity, of the causes of
      national decay, he knew no more than his master. It is curious to observe
      the contrast between the dexterity with which he ruled the conscience of a
      foolish valetudinarian, and the imbecility which he showed when placed at
      the head of an empire. On what grounds Lord Mahon represents the Cardinal
      as a man &ldquo;of splendid genius,&rdquo; &ldquo;of vast abilities,&rdquo; we are unable to
      discover. Lewis was of a very different opinion, and Lewis was very seldom
      mistaken in his judgment of character. &ldquo;Every body,&rdquo; says he, in a letter
      to his ambassador, &ldquo;knows how incapable the Cardinal is. He is an object
      of contempt to his countrymen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few miserable savings were made, which ruined <span class="pagenum">105</span><a
      name="link105" id="link105"></a>individuals without producing any
      perceptible benefit to the state. The police became more and more
      inefficient. The disorders of the capital were increased by the arrival of
      French adventurers, the refuse of Parisian brothels and gaming-houses.
      These wretches considered the Spaniards as a subjugated race whom the
      countrymen of the new sovereign might cheat and insult with impunity. The
      King sate eating and drinking all night, lay in bed all day, yawned at the
      council table, and suffered the most important papers to lie unopened for
      weeks. At length he was roused by the only excitement of which his
      sluggish nature was susceptible. His grandfather consented to let him have
      a wife. The choice was fortunate. Maria Louisa, Princess of Savoy, a
      beautiful and graceful girl of thirteen, already a woman in person and
      mind, at the age when the females of colder climates are still children,
      was the person selected. The King resolved to give her the meeting in
      Catalonia. He left his capital, of which he was already thoroughly tired.
      At setting out he was mobbed by a gang of beggars. He, however, made his
      way through them, and repaired to Barcelona.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis was perfectly aware that the Queen would govern Philip. He,
      accordingly, looked about for somebody to govern the Queen. He selected
      the Princess Orsini to be first lady of the bedchamber, no insignificant
      post in the household of a very young wife, and a very uxorious husband.
      The princess was the daughter of a French peer, and the widow of a Spanish
      grandee. She was, therefore, admirably fitted by her position to be the
      instrument of the Court of Versailles at the Court of Madrid. The Duke of
      Orleans called her, in words too coarse for translation, the Lieutenant of
      Captain Maintenon; and the appellation <span class="pagenum">106</span><a
      name="link106" id="link106"></a>was well deserved. She aspired to play in
      Spain the part which Madame de Maintenon had played in France. But, though
      at least equal to her model in wit, information, and talents for intrigue,
      she had not that self-command, that patience, that imperturbable evenness
      of temper, which had raised the widow of a buffoon to be the consort of
      the proudest of kings. The Princess was more than fifty years old, but was
      still vain of her fine eyes, and her fine shape; she still dressed in the
      style of a girl; and she still carried her flirtations so far as to give
      occasion for scandal. She was, however, polite, eloquent, and not
      deficient in strength of mind. The bitter Saint Simon owns that no person
      whom she wished to attach could long resist the graces of her manners and
      of her conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have not time to relate how she obtained, and how she preserved her
      empire over the young couple in whose household she was placed, how she
      became so powerful, that neither minister of Spain nor ambassador from
      France could stand against her, how Lewis himself was compelled to court
      her, how she received orders from Versailles to retire, how the Queen took
      part with her favourite attendant, how the King took part with the Queen,
      and how, after much squabbling, lying, shuffling, bullying, and coaxing,
      the dispute was adjusted. We turn to the events of the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      When hostilities were proclaimed at London, Vienna, and the Hague, Philip
      was at Naples. He had been with great difficulty prevailed upon, by the
      most urgent representations from Versailles, to separate himself from his
      wife, and to repair without her to his Italian dominions, which were then
      menaced by the Emperor. The Queen acted as Regent, and, child as she was,
      seems to <span class="pagenum">107</span><a name="link107" id="link107"></a>have
      been quite as competent to govern the kingdom as her husband or any of his
      ministers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In August, 1702, an armament, under the command of the Duke of Ormond,
      appeared off Cadiz. The Spanish authorities had no funds and no regular
      troops. The national spirit, however, supplied in some degree what was
      wanting. The nobles and farmers advanced money. The peasantry were formed
      into what the Spanish writers call bands of heroic patriots, and what
      General Stanhope calls a &ldquo;rascally foot militia.&rdquo; If the invaders had
      acted with vigour and judgment, Cadiz would probably have fallen. But the
      chiefs of the expedition were divided by national and professional
      feelings, Dutch against English, and land against sea. Sparre, the Dutch
      general, was sulky and perverse. Bellasys, the English general, embezzled
      the stores. Lord Mahon imputes the ill temper of Sparre to the influence
      of the republican institutions of Holland. By parity of reason, we suppose
      that he would impute the peculations of Bellasys to the influence of the
      monarchical and aristocratical institutions of England. The Duke of
      Ormond, who had the command of the whole expedition, proved on this
      occasion, as on every other, destitute of the qualities which great
      emergencies require. No discipline was kept; the soldiers were suffered to
      rob and insult those whom it was most desirable to conciliate. Churches
      were robbed; images were pulled down; nuns were violated. The officers
      shared the spoil instead of punishing the spoilers; and at last the
      armament, loaded, to use the words of Stanhope, &ldquo;with a great deal of
      plunder and infamy,&rdquo; quitted the scene of Essex&rsquo;s glory, leaving the only
      Spaniard of note who had declared for them to be hanged by his countrymen.
      <span class="pagenum">108</span><a name="link108" id="link108"></a>The
      fleet was off the coast of Portugal on the way back to England, when the
      Duke of Ormond received intelligence that the treasure ships from America
      had just arrived in Europe, and had, in order to avoid his armament,
      repaired to the harbour of Vigo. The cargo consisted, it was said, of more
      than three millions sterling tin gold and silver, besides much valuable
      merchandise. The prospect of plunder reconciled all disputes. Dutch and
      English, admirals and generals, were equally eager for action. The
      Spaniards might with the greatest ease have secured the treasure by simply
      landing it; but it was a fundamental law of Spanish trade that the
      galleons should unload at Cadiz, and at Cadiz only. The Chamber of
      Commerce at Cadiz, in the true spirit of monopoly, refused, even at this
      conjuncture, to bate one jot of its privilege. The matter was referred to
      the Council of the Indies. That body deliberated and hesitated just a day
      too long. Some feeble preparations for defence were made. Two ruined
      towers at the mouth of the bay of Vigo were garrisoned by a few ill-armed
      and untrained rustics; a boom was thrown across the entrance of the basin;
      and a few French ships of war, which had convoyed the galleons from
      America, were moored within. But all was to no purpose. The English ships
      broke the boom; Ormond and his soldiers scaled the forts; the French
      burned their ships, and escaped to the shore. The conquerors shared some
      millions of dollars; some millions more were sunk. When all the galleons
      had been captured or destroyed came an order in due form allowing them to
      unload.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Philip returned to Madrid in the beginning of 1703, he found the
      finances more embarrassed, the people more discontented, and the hostile
      coalition more <span class="pagenum">109</span><a name="link109"
       id="link109"></a>formidable than ever. The loss of the galleons had
      occasioned a great deficiency in the revenue. The Admiral of Castile, one
      of the greatest subjects in Europe, had fled to Lisbon and sworn
      allegiance to the Archduke. The King of Portugal soon after acknowledged
      Charles as King of Spain, and prepared to support the title of the House
      of Austria by arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side, Lewis sent to the assistance of his grandson an army of
      12,000 men, commanded by the Duke of Berwick. Berwick was the son of James
      the Second and Arabella Churchill. He had been brought up to expect the
      highest honours which an English subject could enjoy; but the whole course
      of his life was changed by the revolution which overthrew his infatuated
      father. Berwick became an exile, a man without a country; and from that
      time forward his camp was to him in the place of a country, and
      professional honour was his patriotism. He ennobled his wretched calling.
      There was a stern, cold, Brutus-like virtue in the manner in which he
      discharged the duties of a soldier of fortune. His military fidelity was
      tried by the strongest temptations, and was found invincible. At one time
      he fought against his uncle: at another time he fought against the cause
      of his brother; yet he was never suspected of treachery, or even of
      slackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in 1704, an army composed of English, Dutch, and Portuguese, was
      assembled on the western frontier of Spain. The Archduke Charles had
      arrived at Lisbon, and appeared in person at the head of his troops. The
      military skill of Berwick held the Allies, who were commanded by Lord
      Galway, in check through the whole campaign. On the south, however, a
      great blow was struck. An English fleet, under Sir George Rooke, having on
      board several regiments commanded <span class="pagenum">110</span><a
      name="link110" id="link110"></a>by the Prince of Hesse Darmstadt, appeared
      before the rock of Gibraltar. That celebrated stronghold, which nature has
      made all but impregnable, and against which all the resources of the
      military art have been employed in vain, was taken as easily as if it had
      been an open village in a plain. The garrison went to say their prayers
      instead of standing on their guard. A few English sailors climbed the
      rock. The Spaniards capitulated; and the British flag was placed on those
      ramparts from which the combined armies and navies of France and Spain
      have never been able to pull it down. Rooke proceeded to Malaga, gave
      battle in the neighbourhood of that port to a French squadron, and after a
      doubtful action returned to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      But greater events were at hand. The English government had determined to
      send an expedition to Spain, under the command of Charles Mordaunt Earl of
      Peterborough. This man was, if not the greatest, yet assuredly the most
      extraordinary character of that age, the King of Sweden himself not
      excepted. Indeed, Peterborough maybe described as a polite, learned and
      amorous Charles the Twelfth. His courage had all the French impetuosity,
      and all the English steadiness. His fertility and activity of mind were
      almost beyond belief. They appeared in every thing that he did, in his
      campaigns, in his negotiations, in his familiar correspondence, in his
      lightest and most unstudied conversation. He was a kind friend, a generous
      enemy, and in deportment a thorough gentleman. But his splendid talents
      and virtues were rendered almost useless to his country, by his levity,
      his restlessness, his irritability, his morbid craving for novelty and for
      excitement. His weaknesses had not only brought him, on more than one
      occasion, into serious trouble; but had <span class="pagenum">111</span><a
      name="link111" id="link111"></a>impelled him to some actions altogether
      unworthy of his humane and noble nature. Repose was insupportable to him.
      He loved to fly round Europe faster than a travelling courier. He was at
      the Hague one week, at Vienna the next. Then he took a fancy to see
      Madrid; and he had scarcely reached Madrid, when he ordered horses and set
      off for Copenhagen. No attendants could keep up with his speed. No bodily
      infirmities could confine him. Old age, disease, imminent death, produced
      scarcely any effect on his intrepid spirit. Just before he underwent the
      most horrible of surgical operations, his conversation was as sprightly as
      that of a young man in the full vigour of health. On the day after the
      operation, in spite of the entreaties of his medical advisers, he would
      set out on a journey. His figure was that of a skeleton. But his elastic
      mind supported him under fatigues and sufferings which seemed sufficient
      to bring the most robust man to the grave. Change of employment was as
      necessary to him as change of place. He loved to dictate six or seven
      letters at once. Those who had to transact business with him complained
      that though he talked with great ability on every subject, he could never
      be kept to the point. &ldquo;Lord Peterborough,&rdquo; said Pope, &ldquo;would say very
      pretty and lively things in his letters, but they would be rather too gay
      and wandering; whereas, were Lord Bolingbroke to write to an emperor, or
      to a statesman, he would fix on that point which was the most material,
      would set it in the strongest and finest light, and manage it so as to
      make it the most serviceable to his purpose.&rdquo; What Peterborough was to
      Bolingbroke as a writer, he was to Marlborough as a general. He was, in
      truth, the last of the knights-errant, brave to temerity, liberal to
      profusion, courteous <span class="pagenum">112</span><a name="link112"
       id="link112"></a>in his dealings with enemies, the protector of the
      oppressed, the adorer of women. His virtues and vices were those of the
      Round Table. Indeed, his character can hardly be better summed up, than in
      the lines in which the author of that clever little poem, <i>Monks and
      Giants</i>, has described Sir Tristram. <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"His
      birth, it seems, by Merlin&rsquo;s calculation, <br /><span class="indent20">Was
      under Venus, Mercury, and Mars; <br /><span class="indent20">His mind with
      all their attributes was mixed, <br /><span class="indent20">And, like
      those planets, wandering and unfixed. <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"From
      realm to realm he ran, and never staid: <br /><span class="indent20">Kingdoms
      and crowns he won, and gave away: <br /><span class="indent20">It seemed as
      if his labours were repaid <br /><span class="indent20">By the mere noise
      and movement of the fray: <br /><span class="indent20">No conquests nor
      acquirements had he made; <br /><span class="indent20">His chief delight
      was, on some festive day <br /><span class="indent20">To ride triumphant-,
      prodigal, and proud, <br /><span class="indent20">And shower his wealth
      amidst the shouting crowd. <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"His schemes
      of war were sudden, unforeseen, <br /><span class="indent20">Inexplicable,
      both to friend and foe; <br /><span class="indent20">It seemed as if some
      momentary spleen <br /><span class="indent20">Inspired the project and
      impelled the blow; <br /><span class="indent20">And most his fortune and
      success were seen <br /><span class="indent20">With means the most
      inadequate and low; <br /><span class="indent20">Most master of himself,
      and least encumbered, <br /><span class="indent20">When overmatched,

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In June, 1705, this remarkable man arrived in Lisbon with five thousand
      Dutch and English soldiers. There the Archduke embarked with a large train
      of attendants, whom Peterborough entertained munificently during the
      voyage at his own expense. From Lisbon the armament proceeded to
      Gibraltar, and, having taken the Prince of Hesse Darmstadt on board,
      steered towards the north-east alone the coast of Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first place at which the expedition touched, <span class="pagenum">113</span><a
      name="link113" id="link113"></a>after leaving Gibraltar, was Alter, in
      Valencia. The wretched misgovernment of Philip had excited great
      discontent throughout this province. The invaders were eagerly welcomed.
      The peasantry flocked to the shore, bearing provisions, and shouting,
      &ldquo;Long live Charles the Third.&rdquo; The neighbouring fortress of Dénia
      surrendered without a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imagination of Peterborough took fire. He conceived the hope of
      finishing the war at one blow. Madrid was but a hundred and fifty miles
      distant. There was scarcely one fortified place on the road. The troops of
      Philip were either on the frontiers of Portugal or on the coast of
      Catalonia. At the capital there was no military force, except a few horse
      who formed a guard of honour round the person of Philip. But the scheme of
      pushing into the heart of a great kingdom with an army of only seven
      thousand men, was too daring to please the Archduke. The Prince of Hesse
      Darmstadt, who, in the reign of the late Kino-of Spain, had been Governor
      of Catalonia, and who overrated his own influence in that province, was of
      opinion that they ought instantly to proceed thither, and to attack
      Barcelona. Peterborough was hampered by his instructions, and found it
      necessary to submit.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the sixteenth of August the fleet arrived before Barcelona; and
      Peterborough found that the task assigned to him by the Archduke and the
      Prince was one of almost insuperable difficulty. One side of the city was
      protected by the sea; the other by the strong fortifications of Monjuich.
      The walls were so extensive that thirty thousand men would scarcely have
      been sufficient to invest them. The garrison was as numerous as the
      besieging army. The best officers in the Spanish service were in the town.
      The hopes <span class="pagenum">114</span><a name="link114" id="link114"></a>which
      the Prince of Darmstadt had formed of a gen-end rising in Catalonia, were
      grievously disappointed. The invaders were joined only by about fifteen
      hundred armed peasants, whose services cost more than they were worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      No general was ever in a more deplorable situation than that in which
      Peterborough was now placed, he had always objected to the scheme of
      besieging Barcelona. His objections had been overruled. He had to execute
      a project which he had constantly represented as impracticable. His camp
      was divided into hostile factions, and he was censured by all. The
      Archduke and the Prince blamed him for not proceeding instantly to take
      the town; but suggested no plan by which seven thousand men could be
      enabled to do the work of thirty thousand. Others blamed their general for
      giving up his own opinion to the childish whims of Charles, and for
      sacrificing his men in an attempt to perform what was impossible. The
      Dutch commander positively declared that his soldiers should not stir:
      Lord Peterborough might give what orders he chose; but to engage in such a
      siege was madness; and the men should not be sent to certain death where
      there was no chance of obtaining any advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after three weeks of inaction, Peterborough announced his fixed
      determination to raise the siege. The heavy cannon were sent on board.
      Preparations were made for reembarking the troops. Charles and the Prince
      of Hesse were furious; but most of the officers blamed their general for
      having delayed so long the measure which he had at last found it necessary
      to take. On the 12th of September there were rejoicings and public
      entertainments in Barcelona for this great deliverance. On the following
      morning <span class="pagenum">115</span><a name="link115" id="link115"></a>the
      English flag was flying on the ramparts of Monjuich.
    </p>
    <p>
      The genius and energy of one man had supplied the place of forty
      battalions.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight Peterborough had called on the Prince of Hesse, with whom he
      had not for some time been on speaking terms. &ldquo;I have resolved, sir,&rdquo; said
      the Earl, &ldquo;to attempt an assault; you may accompany us if you think fit,
      and see whether I and my men deserve what you have been pleased to say of
      us.&rdquo; The Prince was startled. The attempt, he said, was hopeless, but he
      was ready to take his share; and, without further discussion, he called
      for his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifteen hundred English soldiers were assembled under the Earl. A thousand
      more had been posted as a body of reserve at a neighbouring convent, under
      the command of Stanhope. After a winding march along the foot of the
      hills, Peterborough and his little army reached the walls of Monjuich.
      There they halted till daybreak. As soon as they were descried, the enemy
      advanced into the outer ditch to meet them. This was the event on which
      Peterborough had reckoned, and for which his men were prepared. The
      English received the fire, rushed forward, leaped into the ditch, put the
      Spaniards to flight, and entered the works together with the fugitives.
      Before the garrison had recovered from their first surprise, the Earl was
      master of the outworks, had taken several pieces of cannon, and had thrown
      up a breastwork to defend his men. He then sent off for Stanhope&rsquo;s
      reserve. While he was waiting for this reinforcement, news arrived that
      three thousand men were marching from Barcelona towards Monjuich. He
      instantly rode out to take a view of them; but no sooner had he left his
      troops than they were seized with a panic. Their situation <span
      class="pagenum">116</span><a name="link116" id="link116"></a>was indeed
      full of danger; they had been brought into Monjuich they scarcely knew
      how; their numbers were small: their general was gone: their hearts failed
      them, and they were proceeding to evacuate the fort. Peterborough received
      information of these, occurrences in time to stop the retreat. He galloped
      up to the fugitives, addressed a few words to them, and put himself at
      their head. The sound of his voice and the sight of his face restored all
      their courage, and they marched back to their former position.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince of Hesse had fallen in the confusion of the assault; but every
      thing else went well. Stanhope arrived; the detachment which had inarched
      out of Barcelona retreated; the heavy cannon were disembarked, and brought
      to bear on the inner fortifications of Monjuich, which speedily fell.
      Peterborough, with his usual generosity, rescued the Spanish soldiers from
      the ferocity of his victorious army, and paid the last honours with great
      pomp to his rival the Prince of Hesse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reduction of Monjuich was the first of a series of brilliant exploits.
      Barcelona fell; and Peterborough had the glory of taking, with a handful
      of men, one of the largest and strongest towns of Europe. He had also the
      glory, not less dear to his chivalrous temper, of saving the life and
      honour of the beautiful Duchess of Popoli, whom he met flying with
      dishevelled hair from the fury of the soldiers. He availed himself
      dexterously of the jealousy with which the Catalonians regarded the
      inhabitants of Castile. He guaranteed to the province in the capital of
      which he was now quartered all its ancient rights and liberties, and thus
      succeeded in attaching the population to the Austrian cause. <span
      class="pagenum">117</span><a name="link117" id="link117"></a>The open
      country now declared in favour of Charles. Tarragona, Tortosa, Gerona,
      Lerida, San Mateo, threw open their gates. The Spanish government sent the
      Count of Las Torres with seven thousand men to reduce San Mateo. The Earl
      of Peterborough, with only twelve hundred men, raised the siege. His
      officers advised him to be content with this extraordinary success.
      Charles urged him to return to Barcelona; but no remonstrances could stop
      such a spirit in the midst of such a career. It was the depth of winter.
      The country was mountainous. The roads were almost impassable. The men
      were ill-clothed. The horses were knocked up. The retreating army was far
      more numerous than the pursuing army. But difficulties and dangers
      vanished before the energy of Peterborough. He pushed on, driving Las
      Torres before him. Nules surrendered to the mere terror of his name; and,
      on the fourth of February, 1706, he arrived in triumph at Valencia. There
      he learned that a body of four thousand men was on the march to join Las
      Torres. He set out at dead of night from Valencia, passed the Xucar, came
      unexpectedly on the encampment of the enemy, and slaughtered, dispersed,
      or took the whole reinforcement. The Valencians could scarcely believe
      their eyes when they saw the prisoners brought in.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time the Courts of Madrid and Versailles, exasperated and
      alarmed by the fall of Barcelona and by the revolt of the surrounding
      country, determined to make a great effort. A large army, nominally
      commanded by Philip, but really under the orders of Marshal Tessé, entered
      Catalonia. A fleet under the Count of Toulouse, one of the natural
      children of Lewis the Fourteenth, appeared before the port of Barcelona.
      <span class="pagenum">118</span><a name="link118" id="link118"></a>The
      city was attacked at once by sea and land. The person of the Archduke was
      in considerable danger. Peterborough, at the head of about three thousand
      men, inarched with great rapidity from Valencia. To give battle, with so
      small a force, to a great regular army under the conduct of a Marshal of
      France, would have been madness. The Earl therefore made war after the
      fashion of the Minas and Empecinados of our own time. He took his post on
      the neighbouring mountains, harassed the enemy with incessant alarms, cut
      off their stragglers, intercepted their communications with the interior,
      and introduced supplies, both of men and provisions into the town. He saw,
      however, that the only hope of the besieged was on the side of the sea.
      His commission from the British government gave him supreme power, not
      only over the army, but, whenever he should be actually on board, over the
      navy also. He put out to sea at night in an open boat, without
      communicating his design to any person. He was picked up, several leagues
      from the shore, by one of the ships of the English squadron. As soon as he
      was on board, he announced himself as first in command, and sent a pinnace
      with his orders to the Admiral. Had these orders been given a few hours
      earlier, it is probable that the whole French fleet would have been taken.
      As it was, the Count of Toulouse put out to sea. The port was open. The
      town was relieved. On the following night the enemy raised the siege and
      retreated to Roussillon. Peterborough returned to Valencia, a place which
      he preferred to every other in Spain; and Philip, who had been some weeks
      absent from his wife, could endure the misery of separation no longer, and
      flew to rejoin her at Madrid.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Madrid, however, it was impossible for him or for <span class="pagenum">119</span><a
      name="link119" id="link119"></a>her to remain. The splendid success which
      Peterborough had obtained on the eastern coast of the Peninsula had
      inspired the sluggish Galway with emulation. He advanced into the heart of
      Spain. Berwick retreated. Alcantara, Ciudad Rodrigo, and Salamanca fell,
      and the conquerors marched towards the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was earnestly pressed by his advisers to remove the seat of
      government to Burgos. The advanced guard of the allied army was already
      seen on the heights above Madrid. It was known that the main body was at
      hand. The unfortunate Prince fled with his Queen and his household. The
      royal wanderers, after travelling eight days on bad roads, under a burning
      sun, and sleeping eight nights in miserable hovels, one of which fell down
      and nearly crushed them both to death, reached the Metropolis of Old
      Castile. In the mean time the invaders had entered Madrid in triumph, and
      had proclaimed the Archduke in the streets of the imperial city. Arragon,
      ever jealous of the Castilian ascendency, followed the example of
      Catalonia. Saraoossa revolted without seeing an enemy. The governor whom
      Philip had set over Carthagena betrayed his trust, and surrendered to the
      Allies the best arsenal and the last ships which Spain possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toledo had been for some time the retreat of two ambitious, turbulent, and
      vindictive intriguers, the Queen Dowager and Cardinal Porto Carrero. They
      had long been deadly enemies. They had led the adverse factions of Austria
      and France. Each had in turn domineered over the weak and disordered mind
      of the late King. At length the impostures of the priest had triumphed
      over the blandishments of the woman; Porto Carrero had remained
      victorious; and the Queen had fled in shame and mortification, from the
      court where <span class="pagenum">120</span><a name="link120" id="link120"></a>she
      had once been supreme. In her retirement she was soon joined by him whose
      arts had destroyed her influence. The cardinal, having held power just
      long enough to convince all parties of his incompetency, had been
      dismissed to his See, cursing his own folly and the ingratitude of the
      House which he had served too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Common interests and common enmities reconciled the fallen rivals. The
      Austrian troops were admitted into Toledo without opposition. The Queen
      Dowager flung off that mournful garb which the widow of a King of Spain
      wears through her whole life, and blazed forth in jewels. The Cardinal
      blessed the standards of the invaders in his magnificent cathedral, and
      lighted up his palace in honour of the great deliverance. It seemed that
      the struggle had terminated in favour of the Archduke, and that nothing
      remained for Philip but a prompt flight into the dominions of his
      grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      So judged those who were ignorant of the character and habits of the
      Spanish people. There is no country in Europe which it is so easy to
      overrun as Spain: there is no country in Europe which it is more difficult
      to conquer. Nothing can be more contemptible than the regular military
      resistance which Spain offers to an invader; nothing more formidable than
      the energy which she puts forth when her regular military resistance has
      been beaten down. Her armies have long borne too much resemblance to mobs;
      but her mobs have had, in an unusual degree, the spirit of armies. The
      soldier, as compared with other soldiers, is deficient in military
      qualities; but the peasant has as much of those qualities as the soldier.
      In no country have such strong fortresses been taken by surprise: in no
      country have unfortified towns made so furious and <span class="pagenum">121</span><a
      name="link121" id="link121"></a>obstinate a resistance to great armies.
      War in Spain has, from the days of the Romans, had a character of its own
      it is a fire which cannot he raked out; it burns fiercely under the
      embers; and long after it has, to all seeming, been extinguished, bursts
      forth more violently than ever. This was seen in the last war. Spain had
      no army which could have looked in the face an equal number of French or
      Prussian soldiers; but one day laid the Prussian monarchy in the dust; one
      day put the crown of France at the disposal of invaders. No Jena, no
      Waterloo, would have enabled Joseph to reign in quiet at Madrid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conduct of the Castilians throughout the War of the Succession was
      most characteristic. With all the odds of number and situation on their
      side, they had been ignominiously beaten. All the European dependencies of
      the Spanish crown were lost. Catalonia, Arragon, and Valencia had
      acknowledged the Austrian Prince. Gibraltar had been taken by a few
      sailors; Barcelona stormed by a few dismounted dragoons. The invaders had
      penetrated into the centre of the Peninsula, and were quartered at Madrid
      and Toledo. While these events had been in progress, the nation had
      scarcely given a sign of life. The rich could hardly be prevailed on to
      give or to lend for the support of war; the troops had shown neither
      discipline nor courage; and now at last, when it seemed that all was lost,
      when it seemed that the most sanguine must relinquish all hope, the
      national spirit awoke, fierce, proud, and unconquerable. The people had
      been sluggish when the circumstances might well have inspired hope; they
      reserved all their energy for what appeared to be a season of despair.
      Castile, Leon, Andalusia, Estremadura, rose at once; every peasant <span
      class="pagenum">122</span><a name="link122" id="link122"></a>procured a
      firelock or a pike; the Allies were masters only of the ground on which
      they trod. No soldier could wander a hundred yards from the main body of
      the invading army without imminent risk of being poniarded. The country
      through which the conquerors had passed to Madrid, and which, as they
      thought, they had subdued, was all in arms behind them. Their
      communications with Portugal were cut off. In the mean time, money began,
      for the first time, to flow rapidly into the treasury of the fugitive
      king. &ldquo;The day before yesterday,&rdquo; says the Princess Orsini, in a letter
      written at this time, &ldquo;the priest of a village which contains only a
      hundred and twenty houses brought a hundred and twenty pistoles to the
      Queen. &lsquo;My flock,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;are ashamed to send you so little; but they
      beg you to believe that in this purse there are a hundred and twenty
      hearts faithful even to the death.&rsquo; The good man wept as he spoke; and
      indeed we wept too. Yesterday another small village, in which there are
      only twenty houses, sent us fifty pistoles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the Castilians were everywhere arming in the cause of Philip, the
      Allies ware serving that cause as effectually by their mismanagement.
      Galway staid at Madrid, where his soldiers indulged in such boundless
      licentiousness that one half of them were in the hospitals. Charles
      remained dawdling in Catalonia. Peterborough had taken Requena, and wished
      to march from Valencia towards Madrid, and to effect a junction with
      Galway; but the Archduke refused his consent to the plan. The indignant
      general remained accordingly in his favourite city, on the beautiful
      shores of the Mediterranean, reading Don Quixote, giving balls and
      suppers, trying in vain to get some good <span class="pagenum">123</span><a
      name="link123" id="link123"></a>sport out of the Valencia bulls, and
      making love, not in vain, to the Valencian women.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the Archduke advanced into Castile, and ordered Peterborough to
      join him. But it was too late. Berwick had already compelled Galway to
      evacuate Madrid; and, when the whole force of the Allies was collected at
      Guadalaxara, it was found to be decidedly inferior in numbers to that of
      the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peterborough formed a plan for regaining possession of the capital. His
      plan was rejected by Charles. The patience of the sensitive and
      vainglorious hero was worn out. He had none of that serenity of temper
      which enabled Marlborough to act in perfect harmony with Eugene, and to
      endure the vexatious interference of the Dutch deputies. He demanded
      permission to leave the army. Permission was readily granted; and he set
      out for Italy. That there might be some pretext for his departure, he was
      commissioned by the Archduke to raise a loan in Genoa on the credit of the
      revenues of Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment to the end of the campaign the tide of fortune ran strong
      against the Austrian cause. Berwick had placed his army between the Allies
      and the frontiers of Portugal. They retreated on Valencia, and arrived in
      that province, leaving about ten thousand prisoners in the hands of the
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In January, 1707, Peterborough arrived at Valencia from Italy, no longer
      bearing a public character, but merely as a volunteer. His advice was
      asked, and it seems to have been most judicious. He gave it as his decided
      opinion that no offensive operations against Castile ought to be
      undertaken. It would be easy, he said, to defend Arragon, Catalonia, and
      Valencia, against Philip. The inhabitants of those parts of <span
      class="pagenum">124</span><a name="link124" id="link124"></a>Spain were
      attached to the cause of the Archduke; and the armies of the House of
      Bourbon would be resisted by the whole population. In a short time the
      enthusiasm of the Castilians might abate. The government of Philip might
      commit unpopular acts. Defeats in the Netherlands might compel Lewis to
      withdraw the succours which he had furnished to his grandson. Then would
      be the time to strike a decisive blow. This excellent advice was rejected.
      Peterborough, who had now received formal letters of recall from England,
      departed before the opening of the campaign; and with him departed the
      good fortune of the Allies. Scarcely any general had ever done so much
      with means so small. Scarcely any general had ever displayed equal
      originality and boldness. He possessed, in the highest degree, the art of
      conciliating those whom he had subdued. But he was not equally successful
      in winning the attachment of those with whom he acted. He was adored by
      the Catalonians and Valencians; but he was hated by the prince whom he had
      all but made a great king, and by the generals whose fortune and
      reputation were staked on the same venture with his own. The English
      government could not understand him. He was so eccentric that they gave
      him no credit for the judgment which he really possessed. One day he took
      towns with horse-soldiers; then again he turned some hundreds of infantry
      into cavalry at a minute&rsquo;s notice. He obtained his political intelligence
      chiefly by means of love affairs, and filled his despatches with epigrams.
      The ministers thought that it would be highly impolitic to intrust the
      conduct of the Spanish war to so volatile and romantic a person. They
      therefore gave the command to Lord Galway, an experienced veteran, a man
      who was in war <span class="pagenum">125</span><a name="link125"
       id="link125"></a>what Moliere&rsquo;s doctors were in medicine, who thought it
      much more honourable to fail according to rule, than to succeed by
      innovation, and who would have been very much ashamed of himself if he had
      taken Monjuich by means so strange as those which Peterborough employed.
      This great commander conducted the campaign of 1707 in the most scientific
      manner. On the plain of Almanza he encountered the army of the Bourbons.
      He drew up his troops according to the methods prescribed by the best
      writers, and in a few hours lost eighteen thousand men, a hundred and
      twenty standards, all his baggage and all his artillery. Valencia and
      Arragon were instantly conquered by the French, and, at the close of the
      year, the mountainous province of Catalonia was the only part of Spain
      which still adhered to Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember, child,&rdquo; says the foolish woman in the Spectator to her
      husband, &ldquo;that the pigeon-house fell the very afternoon that our careless
      wench spilt the salt upon the table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; replies the gentleman, &ldquo;and the next post brought us an
      account of the battle of Almanza.&rdquo; The approach of disaster in Spain had
      been for some time indicated by omens much clearer than the mishap of the
      saltcellar; an ungrateful prince, an undisciplined army, a divided
      council, envy triumphant over merit, a man of genius recalled, a pedant
      and a sluggard intrusted with supreme command. The battle of Almanza
      decided the fate of Spain. The loss was such as Marlborough or Eugene
      could scarcely have retrieved, and was certainly not to be retrieved by
      Stanhope and Staremberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stanhope, who took the command of the English army in Catalonia, was a man
      of respectable abilities, <span class="pagenum">126</span><a name="link126"
       id="link126"></a>both in military and civil affairs, but fitter, we
      conceive, for a second than for a first place. Lord Mahon, with his usual
      candour, tells us, what we believe was not known before, that his
      ancestor&rsquo;s most distinguished exploit, the conquest of Minorea, was
      suggested by Marlborough. Staremberg, a methodical tactician of the German
      school, was sent by the emperor to command in Spain. Two languid campaigns
      followed, during which neither of the hostile armies did any thing
      memorable, but during which both were nearly starved.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, in 1710, the chiefs of the Allied forces resolved to venture on
      bolder measures. They began the campaign with a daring move, pushed into
      Arragon, defeated the troops of Philip at Almenara, defeated them again at
      Saragossa, and advanced to Madrid. The King was again a fugitive. The
      Castilians sprang to arms with the same enthusiasm which they had
      displayed in 1700. The conquerors found the capital a desert. The people
      shut themselves up in their houses, and refused to pay any mark of respect
      to the Austrian prince. It was necessary to hire a few children to shout
      before him in the streets. Meanwhile, the court of Philip at Valladolid
      was thronged by nobles and prelates. Thirty thousand people followed their
      King from Madrid to his new residence. Women of rank, rather than remain
      behind, performed the journey on foot. The peasants enlisted by thousands.
      Money, arms, and provisions, were supplied in abundance by the zeal of the
      people. The country round Madrid was infested by small parties of
      irregular horse. The Allies could not send off a despatch to Arragon, or
      introduce a supply of provisions into the capital. It was unsafe for the
      Archduke to hunt <span class="pagenum">127</span><a name="link127"
       id="link127"></a>in the immediate vicinity of the palace which he
      occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wish of Stanhope was to winter in Castile. But he stood alone in the
      council of war; and, indeed, it is not easy to understand how the Allies
      could have maintained themselves, through so unpropitious a season, in the
      midst of so hostile a population. Charles, whose personal safety was the
      first object of the generals, was sent with an escort of cavalry to
      Catalonia in November; and in December the army commenced its retreat
      towards Arragon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Allies had to do with a master-spirit. The King of France had
      lately sent the Duke of Vendome to command in Spain. This man was
      distinguished by the filthiness of his person, by the brutality of his
      demeanour, by the gross buffonery of his conversation, and by the
      impudence with which he abandoned himself to the most nauseous of all
      vices. His sluggishness was almost incredible. Even when engaged in a
      campaign, he often passed whole days in his bed. His strange torpidity had
      been the cause of some of the most serious disasters which the armies of
      the House of Bourbon had sustained. But when he was roused by any great
      emergency, his resources, his energy, and his presence of mind, were such
      as had been found in no French general since the death of Luxembourg.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this crisis, Vendome was all himself. He set out from Talavera with his
      troops, and pursued the retreating army of the Allies with a speed perhaps
      never equalled, in such a season, and in such a country. He marched night
      and day. He swam, at the head of his cavalry, the flooded stream of
      Henares, and, in a few days, overtook Stanhope, who was at Brihuega <span
      class="pagenum">128</span><a name="link128" id="link128"></a>with the left
      wing of the Allied army. &ldquo;Nobody with me,&rdquo; says the English general,
      &ldquo;imagined that they had any foot within some days&rsquo; march of us; and our
      misfortune is owing to the incredible diligence which their army made.&rdquo;
       Stanhope had but just time to send off a messenger to the centre of the
      army, which was some leagues from Brihuega, before Vendome was upon him.
      The town was invested on every side. The walls were battered with cannon.
      A mine was sprung under one of the gates. The English kept up a terrible
      fire till their powder was spent. They then fought desperately with the
      bayonet against overwhelming odds. They burned the houses which the
      assailants had taken. But all was to no purpose. The British general saw
      that resistance could produce only a useless carnage. He concluded a
      capitulation; and his gallant little army became prisoners of war on
      honourable terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had Vendôme signed the capitulation, when he learned that
      Staremberg was marching to the relief of Stanhope. Preparations were
      instantly made for a general action. On the day following that on which
      the English had delivered up their arms, was fought the obstinate and
      bloody fight of Villa-Viciosa. Staremberg remained master of the field.
      Vendome reaped all the fruits of the battle. The Allies spiked their
      cannon, and retired towards Arragon. But even in Arragon they found no
      place of rest. Vendome was behind them. The guerrilla parties were around
      them. They fled to Catalonia; but Catalonia was invaded by a French army
      from Roussillon. At length the Austrian general, with six thousand
      harassed and dispirited men, the remains of a great and victorious army,
      took refuge in Barcelona, <span class="pagenum">129</span><a name="link129"
       id="link129"></a>almost the only place in Spain which still recognised the
      authority of Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was now much safer at Madrid than his grandfather at Paris. All
      hope of conquering Spain in Spain was at an end. But in other quarters the
      House of Bourbon was reduced to the last extremity. The French armies had
      undergone a series of defeats in Germany, in Italy, and in the
      Netherlands. An immense force, flushed with victory, and commanded by the
      greatest generals of the age, was on the borders of France. Lewis had been
      forced to humble himself before the conquerors. He had even offered to
      abandon the cause of his grandson; and his offer had been rejected. But a
      great turn in affairs was approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English administration which had commenced the war against the House
      of Bourbon was an administration composed of Tories. But the war was a
      Whig war. It was the favourite scheme of William, the Whig King. Lewis had
      provoked it by recognising, as sovereign of England, a prince peculiarly
      hateful to the Whigs. It had placed England in a position of marked
      hostility to that power from which alone the Pretender could expect
      efficient succour. It had joined England in the closest union to a
      Protestant and republican state, to a state which had assisted in bringing
      about the Revolution, and which was willing; to guarantee the execution of
      the Act of Settlement. Marlborough and Godolphin found that they were more
      zealously supported by their old opponents than by their old associates.
      Those ministers who were zealous for the war were gradually converted to
      Whiggism. The rest dropped off, and were succeeded by Whigs. Cowper became
      Chancellor. Sunderland, in spite of the very just antipathy of Anne, was
      made Secretary <span class="pagenum">130</span><a name="link130"
       id="link130"></a>of State. On the death of the Prince of Denmark a more
      extensive change took place. Wharton became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,
      and Somers President of the Council. At length the administration was
      wholly in the hands of the Low Church party.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1710 a violent change took place. The Queen had always been a
      Tory at heart. Her religious feelings were all on the side of the
      Established Church. Her family feelings pleaded in favour of her exiled
      brother. Her selfish feelings disposed her to favour the zealots of
      prerogative. The affection which she felt for the Duchess of Marlborough
      was the great security of the Whigs. That affection had at length turned
      to deadly aversion. While the great party which had long swayed the
      destinies of Europe was undermined by bedchamber women at St. James&rsquo;s, a
      violent storm gathered in the country. A foolish parson had preached a
      foolish sermon against the principles of the Revolution. The wisest member
      of the government were for letting the man alone. But Godolphin, inflamed
      with all the zeal of a new-made Whig, and exasperated by a nickname which
      was applied to him in this unfortunate discourse, insisted that the
      preacher should be impeached. The exhortations of the mild and sagacious
      Somers were disregarded. The impeachment was brought; the doctor was
      convicted; and the accusers were ruined. The clergy came to the rescue of
      the persecuted clergyman. The country gentlemen came to the rescue of the
      clergy. A display of Tory feelings, such as England had not witnessed
      since the closing years of Charles the Second&rsquo;s reign, appalled the
      Ministers and gave boldness to the Queen. She turned out the Whigs, called
      Harley and St. John to power, and dissolved the Parliament. The <span
      class="pagenum">131</span><a name="link131" id="link131"></a>elections
      went strongly against the late government. Stanhope, who had in his
      absence been put in nomination for Westminster, was defeated by a Tory
      candidate. The new Ministers, finding themselves masters of the new
      Parliament, were induced by the strongest motives to conclude a peace with
      France. The whole system of alliance in which the country was engaged was
      a Whig system. The general by whom the English armies had constantly been
      led to victory, and for whom it was impossible to find a substitute, was
      now, whatever he might formerly have been, a Whig general. If Marlborough
      were discarded it was probable that some great disaster would follow. Yet,
      if he were to retain his command, every great action which he might
      perform would raise the credit of the party in opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      A peace was therefore concluded between England and the Princes of the
      House of Bourbon. Of that peace Lord Mahon speaks in terms of the severest
      reprehension. He is, indeed, an excellent Whig of the time of the first
      Lord Stanhope. &ldquo;I cannot but pause for a moment,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to observe how
      much the course of a century has inverted the meaning of our party
      nicknames, how much a modern Tory resembles a Whig of Queen Anne&rsquo;s reign,
      and a Tory of Queen Anne&rsquo;s reign a modern Whig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We grant one half of Lord Mahon&rsquo;s proposition: from the other half we
      altogether dissent. We allow that a modern Tory resembles, in many things,
      a Whig of Queen Anne&rsquo;s reign. It is natural that such should be the case.
      The worst things of one age often resemble the best things of another. A
      modern shopkeeper&rsquo;s house is as well furnished as the house of a
      considerable merchant in Anne&rsquo;s reign. Very plain people now <span
      class="pagenum">132</span><a name="link132" id="link132"></a>wear finer
      cloth than Beau Fielding or Beau Edgeworth could have procured in Queen
      Anne&rsquo;s reign. We would rather trust to the apothecary of a modern village
      than to the physician of a large town in Anne&rsquo;s reign. A modern
      boarding-school miss could tell the most learned professor of Anne&rsquo;s reign
      some things in geography, astronomy, and chemistry, which would surprise
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The science of government is an experimental science; and therefore it is,
      like all other experimental sciences, a progressive science. Lord Mahon
      would have been a very good Whig in the days of Harley. But Harley, whom
      Lord Mahon censures so severely, was very Whiggish when compared even with
      Clarendon; and Clarendon was quite a democrat when compared with Lord
      Burleigh. If Lord Mahon lives, as we hope he will, fifty years longer, we
      have no doubt that, as he now boasts of the resemblance which the Tories
      of our time bear to the Whigs of the Revolution, he will then boast of the
      resemblance borne by the Tories of 1882 to those immortal patriots, the
      Whigs of the Reform Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Society, we believe, is constantly advancing in knowledge. The tail is now
      where the head was some generations ago. But the head and the tail still
      keep their distance. A nurse of this century is as wise as a justice of
      the quorum and custalorum in Shallow&rsquo;s time. The wooden spoon of this year
      would puzzle a senior wrangler of the reign of George the Second. A boy
      from the National School reads and spells better than half the knights of
      the shire in the October Club. But there is still as wide a difference as
      ever between justices and nurses, senior wranglers and wooden spoons,
      members of Parliament and children at charity <span class="pagenum">133</span><a
      name="link133" id="link133"></a>schools. In the same way, though a Tory
      may now be very like what a Whig was a hundred and twenty years ago, the
      Whig is as much in advance of the Tory as ever. The stag, in the Treatise
      on the Bathos, who &ldquo;feared his hind feet would o&rsquo;ertake the fore,&rdquo; was not
      more mistaken than Lord Mahon, if he thinks that he has really come up
      with the Whigs. The absolute position of the parties has been altered; the
      relative position remains unchanged. Through the whole of that great
      movement, which began before these party-names existed, and which will
      continue after they have become obsolete, through the whole of that great
      movement of which the Charter of John, the institution of the House of
      Commons, the extinction of Villanage, the separation from the see of Rome,
      the expulsion of the Stuarts, the reform of the Representative System, are
      successive stages, there have been, under some name or other, two sets of
      men, those who were before their age, and those who were behind it, those
      who were the wisest among their contemporaries, and those who* gloried in
      being no wiser than their great grandfathers. It is delightful to think,
      that, in due time, the last of those who straggle in the rear of the great
      march will occupy the place now occupied by the advanced guard. The Tory
      Parliament of 1710 would have passed for a most liberal Parliament in the
      days of Elizabeth; and there are at present few members of the
      Conservative Club who would not have been fully qualified to sit with
      Halifax and Somers at the Kit-cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though, therefore, we admit that a modern Tory bears some resemblance to a
      Whig of Queen Anne&rsquo;s reign, we can by no means admit that a Tory of Anne&rsquo;s
      reign resembled a modern Whig. Have the modern Whigs passed laws for the
      purpose of closing the <span class="pagenum">134</span><a name="link134"
       id="link134"></a>entrance of the House of Commons against the new
      interests created by trade? Do the modern Whigs bold the doctrine of
      divine right? Have the modern Whigs laboured to exclude all Dissenters
      from office and Power? The modern Whigs are, indeed, at the present
      moment, like the Tories of 1712, desirous of peace, and of close union
      with France. But is there no difference between the France of 1712 and the
      France of 1832? Is France now the stronghold of the &ldquo;Popish tyranny&rdquo; and
      the &ldquo;arbitrary power&rdquo; against which our ancestors fought and prayed? Lord
      Mahon will find, we think, that his parallel is, in all essential
      circumstances, as incorrect as that which Finellen drew between Macedon
      and Monmouth, or as that which an ingenious Tory lately discovered between
      Archbishop Williams and Archbishop Vernon.
    </p>
    <p>
      We agree with Lord Mahon in thinking highly of the Whigs of Queen Anne&rsquo;s
      reign. But that part of their conduct which he selects for especial praise
      is precisely the part which we think most objectionable. We revere them as
      the great champions of political and of intellectual liberty. It is true
      that, when raised to power, they were not exempt from the faults which
      power naturally engenders. It is true that they were men born in the
      seventeenth century, and that they were therefore ignorant of many truths
      which are familiar to the men of the nineteenth century. But they were,
      what the reformers of the Church were before them, and what the reformers
      of the House of Commons have been since, the leaders of their species in a
      right direction. It is true that they did not allow to political
      discussion that latitude which to us appears reasonable and safe; but to
      them we owe the removal of the Censorship. It is true that they did not
      carry <span class="pagenum">135</span><a name="link135" id="link135"></a>the
      principle of religious liberty to its full extent; but to them we owe the
      Toleration Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though, however, we think that the Whigs of Anne&rsquo;s reign, were, as a body,
      far superior in wisdom and public virtue to their contemporaries the
      Tories, we by no means hold ourselves bound to defend all the measures of
      our favourite party. A life of action, if it is to be useful, must be a
      life of compromise. But speculation admits of no compromise. A public man
      is often under the necessity of consenting to measures which he dislikes,
      lest he should endanger the success of measures which he thinks of vital
      importance. But the historian lies under no such necessity. On the
      contrary, it is one of his most sacred duties to point out clearly the
      errors of those whose general conduct he admires.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems to us, then, that, on the great question which divided England
      during the last four years of Anne&rsquo;s reign, the Tories were in the right,
      and the Whigs in the wrong. That question was, whether England ought to
      conclude peace without exacting from Philip a resignation of the Spanish
      crown?
    </p>
    <p>
      No Parliamentary struggle, from the time of the Exclusion Bill to the time
      of the Reform Bill, has been so violent as that which took place between
      the authors of the Treaty of Utrecht and the War Party. The Commons were
      for peace; the Lords were for vigorous hostilities. The queen was
      compelled to choose which of her two highest prerogatives she would
      exercise, whether she would create Peers or dissolve the Parliament. The
      ties of party superseded the ties of neighbourhood and of blood. The
      members of the hostile factions would scarcely speak to each other, or bow
      to each other. The women appeared at the theatres <span class="pagenum">136</span><a
      name="link136" id="link136"></a>bearing the badges of their political
      sect. The schism extended to the most remote counties of England. Talents,
      such as had seldom before been displayed in political controversy, were
      enlisted in the service of the hostile parties. On one side was Steele,
      gay, lively, drunk with animal spirits and with factions animosity, and
      Addison, with his polished satire, his inexhaustible fertility of fancy,
      and his graceful simplicity of style. In the front of the opposite ranks
      appeared a darker and fiercer spirit, the apostate politician, the ribald
      priest, the perjured lover, a heart burning with hatred against the whole
      human race, a mind richly stored with images from the dunghill and the
      lazar-house. The ministers triumphed, and the peace was concluded. Then
      came the reaction. A new sovereign ascended the throne. The Whigs enjoyed
      the confidence of the King and of the Parliament. The unjust severity with
      which the Tories had treated &lsquo;Marlborough and Walpole was more than
      retaliated. Harley and Prior were thrown into prison; Boling-broke and
      Ormond were compelled to take refuge in a foreign land. The wounds
      inflicted in this desperate conflict continued to rankle for many years.
      It was long before the members of either party could discuss the question
      of the peace of Utrecht with calmness and impartiality. That the Whig
      Ministers had sold us to the Dutch; that the Tory Ministers had sold us to
      the French; that the war had been earned on only to fill the pockets of
      Marlborough; that the peace had been concluded only to facilitate the
      return of the Pretender: these imputations and many others, utterly
      unfounded, or grossly exaggerated, were hurled backward and forward by the
      political disputants of the last century. In our time the question may be
      discussed without <span class="pagenum">137</span><a name="link137"
       id="link137"></a>irritation. We will state, as concisely as possible, the
      reasons which have led us to the conclusion at which we have arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dangers which were to be apprehended from the peace were two; first,
      the danger that Philip might be induced, by feelings of private affection,
      to act in strict concert with the elder branch of his house, to favour the
      French trade at the expense of England, and to side with the French
      government in future wars; secondly, the danger that the posterity of the
      Duke of Burgundy might become extinct, that Philip might become heir by
      blood to the French crown, and that thus two great monarchies might be
      united under one sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first danger appears to us altogether chimerical. Family affection has
      seldom produced much effect on the policy of princes. The state of Europe
      at the time of the peace of Utrecht proved that in politics the ties of
      interest are much stronger than those of consanguinity or affinity. The
      Elector of Bavaria had been driven from his dominions by his
      father-in-law; Victor Amadeus was in arms against his sons-in-law; Anne
      was seated on a throne from which she had assisted to push a most
      indulgent father. It is true that Philip had been accustomed from
      childhood to regard his grandfather with profound veneration. It was
      probable, therefore, that the influence of Lewis at Madrid would be very
      great. But Lewis was more than seventy years old; he could not live long;
      his heir was an infant in the cradle. There was surely no reason to think
      that the policy of the King of Spain would be swayed by his regard for a
      nephew whom he had never seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, soon after the peace, the two branches of the <span
      class="pagenum">138</span><a name="link138" id="link138"></a>House of
      Bourbon began to quarrel. A close alliance was formed between Philip and
      Charles, lately competitors for the Castilian crown. A Spanish princess,
      betrothed to the King of France, was sent back in the most insulting
      manner to her native country; and a decree was put forth by the Court of
      Madrid commanding every Frenchman to leave Spain. It is true that, fifty
      years after the peace of Utrecht, an alliance of peculiar strictness was
      formed between the French and Spanish governments. But both governments
      were actuated on that occasion, not by domestic affection, but by common
      interests, and common enmities. Their compact, though called the Family
      Compact, was as purely a political compact as the league of Cambrai or the
      league of Pilnitz.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second danger was that Philip might have succeeded to the crown of his
      native country. This did not happen: but it might have happened; and at
      one time it seemed very likely to happen. A sickly child alone stood
      between the King of Spain and the heritage of Lewis the Fourteenth.
      Philip, it is true, solemnly renounced his claim to the French crown. But
      the manner in which he had obtained possession of the Spanish crown had
      proved the inefficacy of such renunciations. The French lawyers declared
      Philip&rsquo;s renunciation null, as being inconsistent with the fundamental law
      of the realm. The French people would probably have sided with him whom
      they would have considered as the rightful heir. Saint Simon, though much
      less zealous for hereditary monarchy than most of his countrymen, and
      though strongly attached to the Regent, declared, in the presence of that
      prince, that, he never would support the claims of the House of Orleans
      against those of the King of Spain. &ldquo;If <span class="pagenum">139</span><a
      name="link139" id="link139"></a>such,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;be my feelings, what must
      be the feelings of others?&rdquo; Bolingbroke, it is certain, was fully
      convinced that the renunciation was worth no more than the paper on which
      it was written, and demanded it only for the purpose of blinding the
      English Parliament and people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, though it was at one time probable that the posterity of the Duke of
      Burgundy would become ex tinct, and though it is almost certain that, if
      the posterity of the Duke of Burgundy had become extinct, Philip would
      have successfully preferred his claim to the crown of France, we still
      defend the principle of the Treaty of Utrecht. In the first place, Charles
      had, soon after the battle of Villa-Viciosa, inherited, by the death of
      his elder brother, all the dominions of the House of Austria. Surely, if
      to these dominions he had added the whole monarchy of Spain, the balance
      of power would have been seriously endangered. The union of the Austrian
      dominions and Spain would not, it is true, have been so alarming an event
      as the union of France and Spain. But Charles was actually Emperor. Philip
      was not, and never might be, King of France. The certainty of the less
      evil might well be set against the chance of the greater evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in fact, we do not believe that Spain would long have remained under
      the government either of an Emperor or of a King of France. The character
      of the Spanish people was a better security to the nations of Europe than
      any will, any instrument of renunciation, or any treaty. The same energy
      which the people of Castile had put forth when Madrid was occupied by the
      Allied armies, they would have again put forth as soon as it appeared that
      their country was <span class="pagenum">140</span><a name="link140"
       id="link140"></a>about to become a French province. Though they were no
      longer masters abroad, they were by no means disposed to see foreigners
      set over them at home. If Philip had attempted to govern Spain by mandates
      from Versailles, a second Grand Alliance would easily have effected what
      the first had failed to accomplish. The Spanish nation would have rallied
      against him as zealously as it had before rallied round him. And of this
      he seems to have been fully aware. For many years the favourite hope of
      his heart was that he might ascend the throne of his grandfather; but he
      seems never to have thought it possible that he could reign at once in the
      country of his adoption and in the country of his birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the dangers of the peace; and they seem to us to be of no very
      formidable kind. Against these dangers are to be set off&rsquo; the evils of war
      and the risk of failure. The evils of the war, the waste of life, the
      suspension of trade, the expenditure of wealth, the accumulation of debt,
      require no illustration. The chances of failure it is difficult at this
      distance of time to calculate with accuracy. But we think that an estimate
      approximating to the truth may, without much difficulty, be formed. The
      Allies had been victorious in Germany, Italy, and Flanders. It was by no
      means improbable that they might fight their way into the very heart of
      France. But at no time since the commencement of the war had their
      prospects been so dark in that country which was the very object of the
      struggle. In Spain they held only a few square leagues. The temper of the
      great majority of the nation was decidedly hostile to them. If they had
      persisted, if they had obtained success equal to their highest
      expectations, if they had gained a series of victories as splendid <span
      class="pagenum">141</span><a name="link141" id="link141"></a>as those of
      Blenheim and Ramilies, if Paris had fallen, if Lewis had been a prisoner,
      we still doubt whether they would have accomplished their object. They
      would still have had to carry on interminable hostilities against the
      whole population of a country which affords peculiar facilities to
      irregular warfare, and in which invading armies suffer more from famine
      than from the sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are, therefore, for the peace of Utrecht. We are indeed no admirers of
      the statesmen who concluded that peace. Harley, we believe, was a solemn
      trifler, St. John a brilliant knave. The great body of their followers
      consisted of the country clergy and the country gentry; two classes of men
      who were then inferior in intelligence to decent shopkeepers or farmers of
      our time. Parson Barnabas, Parson Trulliber, Sir Wilful Witwould, Sir
      Francis Wronghead, Squire Western, Squire Sullen, such were the people who
      composed the main strength of the Tory party during the sixty years which
      followed the Revolution. It is true that the means by which the Tories
      came into power in 1710 were most disreputable. It is true that the manner
      in which they used their power was often unjust and cruel. It is true
      that, in order to bring about their favourite project of peace, they
      resorted to slander and deception, without the slightest scruple. It is
      true that they passed off on the British nation a renunciation which they
      knew to be invalid. It is true that they gave up the Catalans to the
      vengeance of Philip, in a manner inconsistent with humanity and national
      honour. But on the great question of Peace or War, we cannot but think
      that, though their motives may have been selfish and malevolent, their
      decision was beneficial to the state. <span class="pagenum">142</span><a
      name="link142" id="link142"></a>But we have already exceeded our limits.
      It remains only for us to bid Lord Mahon heartily farewell, and to assure
      him that, whatever dislike we may feel for his political opinions, we
      shall always meet him with pleasure on the neutral ground of literature.

      HORACE WALPOLE. (1)
    </h2>

      (<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, October, 1833.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e <span
      class="pagenum">143</span><a name="link143" id="link143"></a>cannot
      transcribe this titlepage without strong feelings of regret. The editing
      of these volumes was the last of the useful and modest services rendered
      to literature by a nobleman of amiable manners, of untarnished public and
      private character, and of cultivated mind. On this, as on other occasions,
      Lord Dover performed his part diligently, judiciously, and without the
      slightest ostentation. He had two merits which are rarely found together
      in a commentator. He was content to be merely a commentator, to keep in
      the background, and to leave the foreground to the author whom he had
      undertaken to illustrate. Yet, though willing to be an attendant, he was
      by no means a slave; nor did he consider it as part of his duty to see no
      faults in the writer to whom he faithfully and assiduously rendered the
      humblest literary offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faults of Horace Walpole&rsquo;s head and heart are indeed sufficiently
      glaring. His writings, it is true, rank as high among the delicacies of
      intellectual epicures as the Strasburg pies among the dishes
    </p>

     Horace Mann, British Envoy at the Court of Tuscany</i>. Now
     first published from the Originals in the Possession of the

</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">144</span><a name="link144" id="link144"></a>described
      in the <i>Almanach des Grourmands</i>. But as the <i>pâté-de-foie-gras</i>
      owes its excellence to the diseases of the wretched animal which furnishes
      it, and would be good for nothing if it were not made of livers
      preternaturally swollen, so none but an unhealthy and disorganised mind
      could have produced such literary luxuries as the works of Walpole.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, unless we have formed a very erroneous judgment of his character,
      the most eccentric, the most artificial, the most fastidious, the most
      capricious of men. His mind was a bundle of inconsistent whims and
      affectations. His features were covered by mask within mask. When the
      outer disguise of obvious affectation was removed, you were still as far
      as ever from seeing the real man. He played innumerable parts, and
      over-acted them all. When he talked misanthropy, lie out-Timoned Timon.
      When he talked philanthropy, he left Howard at an immeasurable distance.
      He scoffed at courts, and kept a chronicle of their most trifling scandal;
      at society, and was blown about by its slightest veerings of opinion; at
      literary fame, and left fair copies of his private letters, with copious
      notes, to be published after his decease; at rank, and never for a moment
      forgot that he was an Honourable; at the practice of entail, and tasked
      the ingenuity of conveyancers to tie up his villa in the strictest
      settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conformation of his mind was such that whatever was little seemed to
      him great, and whatever was great seemed to him little. Serious business
      was a trifle to him, and trifles were his serious business. To chat with
      blue stockings, to write little copies of complimentary verses on little
      occasions, to superintend a private press, to preserve from natural decay
      <span class="pagenum">145</span><a name="link145" id="link145"></a>the
      perishable topics of Ranelagli and White&rsquo;s, to record divorces and bets,
      Miss Chudleigh&rsquo;s absurdities and George Selwyn&rsquo;s good sayings, to decorate
      a grotesque house with pie-crust battlements, to procure rare engravings
      and antique chimney-boards, to match odd gauntlets, to lay out a maze of
      walks within five acres of ground, these were the grave employments of his
      long life. From these he turned to politics as to an amusement. After the
      labours of the print-shop and the auction-room he unbent his mind in the
      House of Commons. And, having indulged in the recreation of making laws
      and voting millions, he returned to more important pursuits, to researches
      after Queen Mary&rsquo;s comb, Wolsey&rsquo;s red hat, the pipe which Van Tromp smoked
      during his last sea-fight, and the spur which King William struck into the
      flank of Sorrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      In every thing in which Walpole busied himself, in the fine arts, in
      literature, in public affairs, he was drawn by some strange attraction
      from the great to the little, and from the useful to the odd. The politics
      in which he took the keenest interest, were politics scarcely deserving of
      the name. The growlings of George the Second, the flirtations of Princess
      Emily with the Duke of Grafton, the amours of Prince Frederic and Lady
      Middlesex, the squabbles between Gold Stick in waiting and the Master of
      the Buck-hounds, the disagreements between the tutors of Prince George,
      these matters engaged almost all the attention which Walpole could spare
      from matters more important still, from bidding for Zinckes and Petitots,
      from cheapening fragments of tapestry and handles of old lances, from
      joining bits of painted glass, and from setting up memorials of departed
      cats and dogs. While he was fetching and carrying the gossip of Kensington
      <span class="pagenum">146</span><a name="link146" id="link146"></a>Palace
      and Carlton House, he fancied that he was engaged in politics, and when he
      recorded that gossip, he fancied that he was writing history.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, as he has himself told us, fond of faction as an amusement. He
      loved mischief: but he loved quiet; and he was constantly on the watch for
      opportunities of gratifying both his tastes at once, lie sometimes
      contrived, without showing himself, to disturb the course of ministerial
      negotiations and to spread confusion through the political circles. He
      does not himself pretend that, on these occasions, he was actuated by
      public spirit; nor does he appear to have had any private advantage in
      view. He thought it a good practical joke to set public men together by
      the ears; and he enjoyed their perplexities, their accusations, and their
      recriminations, as a malicious boy enjoys the embarrassment of a
      misdirected traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      About politics, in the high sense of the word, he knew nothing, and cared
      nothing. He called himself a Whig. His father&rsquo;s son could scarcely assume
      any other name. It pleased him also to affect a foolish dislike of kings
      as kings, and a foolish love and admiration of rebels as rebels: and
      perhaps, while kings were not in danger, and while rebels were not in
      being, he really believed that he held the doctrines which he professed.
      To go no further than the letters now before us, he is perpetually
      boasting to his friend Mann of his aversion to royalty and to royal
      persons. He calls the crime of Damien &ldquo;that least bad of murders, the
      murder of a king.&rdquo; He hung up in his villa an engraving of the
      death-warrant of Charles, with the inscription &ldquo;<i>Major Charta</i>.&rdquo; Yet
      the most superficial knowledge of history might have taught him that the
      Restoration, and the crimes and follies of the twenty-<span class="pagenum">147</span><a
      name="link147" id="link147"></a>eight years which followed the
      Restoration, were the effects of this Greater Charter. Nor was there much
      in the means by which that instrument was obtained that could gratify a
      judicious lover of liberty. A man must hate kings very bitterly, before he
      can think it desirable that the representatives of the people should be
      turned out of doors by dragoons, in order to get at a king&rsquo;s head.
      Walpole&rsquo;s Whiggism, however, was of a very harmless kind. He kept it, as
      he kept the old spears and helmets at Strawberry Hill, merely for show. He
      would just as soon have thought of taking down the arms of the ancient
      Templars and Hospitallers from the walls of his hall, and setting off on a
      crusade to the Holy Land, as of acting in the spirit of those daring
      warriors and statesmen, great even in their errors, whose names and seals
      were affixed to the warrant which he prized so highly. He liked revolution
      and regicide only when they were a hundred years old. His republicanism,
      like the courage of a bully, or the love of a fribble, was strong and
      ardent when there was no occasion for it, and subsided when he had an
      opportunity of bringing it to the proof. As soon as the revolutionary
      spirit really began to stir in Europe, as soon as the hatred of kings
      became something more than a sonorous phrase, he was frightened into a
      fanatical royalist, and became one of the most extravagant alarmists of
      those wretched times. In truth, his talk about liberty, whether he knew it
      or not, was from the beginning a mere cant, the remains of a phraseology
      which had meant something in the mouths of those from whom he had learned
      it, but which, in his mouth, meant about as much as the oath by which the
      Knights of some modern orders bind themselves to redress the wrongs of all
      injured ladies. <span class="pagenum">148</span><a name="link148"
       id="link148"></a>He had been fed in his boyhood with Whig speculations on
      government. He must often have seen, at Houghton or in Downing Street, men
      who had been Whigs when it was as dangerous to be a Whig as to be a
      highwayman, men who had voted for the Exclusion Bill, who had been
      concealed in garrets and cellars after the battle of Sedgemoor, and who
      had set their names to the declaration that they would live and die with
      the Prince of Orange. He had acquired the language of these men, and he
      repeated it by rote, though it was at variance with all his tastes and
      feelings; just as some old Jacobite families persisted in praying for the
      Pretender, and in passing their glasses over the water decanter, when they
      drank the King&rsquo;s health, long after they had become loyal supporters of
      the government of George the Third. He was a Whig by the accident of
      hereditary connection; but he was essentially a courtier; and not the less
      a courtier because he pretended to sneer at the objects which excited his
      admiration and envy. His real tastes perpetually show themselves through
      the thin disguise. While professing all the contempt of Bradshaw or Ludlow
      for crowned heads, he took the trouble to write a book concerning Royal
      Authors. He pryed with the utmost anxiety into the most minute particulars
      relating to the Royal family. When he was a child, he was haunted with a
      longing to see George the First, and gave his mother no peace till she had
      found a way of gratifying his curiosity. The same feeling, covered with a
      thousand disguises, attended him to the grave. No observation that dropped
      from the lips of Majesty seemed to him too trifling to be recorded. The
      French songs of Prince Frederic, compositions certainly not deserving of
      preservation on account of <span class="pagenum">149</span><a
      name="link149" id="link149"></a>their intrinsic merit, have been carefully
      preserved for us by this contemner of royalty. In truth, every page of
      Walpole&rsquo;s works bewrays him. This Diogenes, who would be thought to prefer
      his tub to a palace, and who has nothing to ask of the masters of Windsor
      and Versailles but that they will stand out of his light, is a
      gentleman-usher at heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, it is plain, an uneasy consciousness of the frivolity of his
      favourite pursuits; and this consciousness produced one of the most
      diverting of his ten thousand affectations. His busy idleness, his
      indifference to matters which the world generally regards as important,
      his passion for trifles, he thought fit to dignify with the name of
      philosophy. He spoke of himself as of a man whose equanimity was proof to
      ambitious hopes and fears, who had learned to rate power, wealth, and fame
      at their true value, and whom the conflict of parties, the rise and fall
      of statesmen, the ebb and flow of public opinion, moved only to a smile of
      mingled compassion and disdain. It was owing to the peculiar elevation of
      his character that he cared about a pinnacle of lath and plaster more than
      about the Middlesex election, and about a miniature of Grammont more than
      about the American Revolution. Pitt and Murray might talk themselves
      hoarse about trifles. But questions of government and war were too
      insignificant to detain a mind which was occupied in recording the scandal
      of club-rooms and the whispers of the back-stairs, and which was even
      capable of selecting and disposing chairs of ebony and shields of
      rhinoceros-skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of his innumerable whims was an extreme unwillingness to be considered
      a man of letters. Not that he was indifferent to literary fame. Far from
      it. <span class="pagenum">150</span><a name="link150" id="link150"></a>Scarcely
      any writer lias ever troubled himself so much about the appearance which
      his works were to make before posterity. But he had set his heart on
      incompatible objects. He wished to be a celebrated author, and yet to be a
      mere idle gentleman, one of those Epicurean gods of the earth who do
      nothing at all, and who pass their existence in the contemplation of their
      own perfections. He did not like to have any thing in common with the
      wretches who lodged in the little courts behind St. Martin&rsquo;s Church, and
      stole out on Sundays to dine with their bookseller. He avoided the society
      of authors. He spoke with lordly contempt of the most distinguished among
      them. He tried to find out some way of writing books, as M. Jourdain&rsquo;s
      father sold cloth, without derogating from his character of <i>Gentilhomme</i>.
      &ldquo;Lui, marchand? C&rsquo;est pure médisance: il ne la jamais été. Tout ce qu&rsquo;il
      faisait, c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;il était fort obligeant, fort officieux; et comme il se
      connaissait fort bien en étoffes, il en allait choisir de tous les côtés,
      les faisait apporter chez lui, et en donnait à ses amis pour de l&rsquo;argent.&rdquo;
       There are several amusing instances of Walpole&rsquo;s feeling on this subject
      in the letters now before us. Mann had complimented him on the learning
      which appeared in the &ldquo;Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors;&rdquo; and it is
      curious to see how impatiently Walpole bore the imputation of having
      attended to any thing so unfashionable as the improvement of his mind. &ldquo;I
      know nothing. How should I? I who have always lived in the big busy world;
      who lie a-bed all the morning, calling it morning as long as you please;
      who sup in company; who have played at faro half my life, and now at loo
      till two and three in the morning; who have always loved pleasure <span
      class="pagenum">151</span><a name="link151" id="link151"></a>haunted
      auctions.... How I have laughed when some of the Magazines have called me
      the learned gentleman. Pray don&rsquo;t be like the Magazines.&rdquo; This folly might
      be pardoned in a boy. But a man between forty and fifty years old, as
      Walpole then was, ought to be quite as much ashamed of playing at loo till
      three every morning as of being that vulgar thing, a learned gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The literary character has undoubtedly its full share of faults, and of
      very serious and offensive faults. If Walpole had avoided those faults, we
      could have pardoned the fastidiousness with which he declined all
      fellowship with men of learning. But from those faults Walpole was not one
      jot more free than the garreteers from whose contact he shrank. Of
      literary meannesses and literary vices, his life and his works contain as
      many instances as the life and the works of any member of Johnson&rsquo;s club.
      The fact is, that Walpole had the faults of Grub Street, with a large
      addition from St. James&rsquo;s Street, the vanity, the jealousy, the
      irritability of a man of letters, the affected superciliousness and apathy
      of a man of <i>ton</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      His judgment of literature, of contemporary literature especially, wars
      altogether perverted by his aristocratical feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      No writer surely was ever guilty of so much false and absurd criticism. He
      almost invariably speaks with contempt of those books which are now
      universally allowed to be the best that appeared in his time; and, on the
      other hand, he speaks of writers of rank and fashion as if they were
      entitled to the same precedence in literature which would have been
      allowed to them in a drawing-room. In these letters, for example, he says
      that he would rather have written the most absurd lines in Lee than <span
      class="pagenum">152</span><a name="link152" id="link152"></a>Thomson&rsquo;s
      Seasons. The periodical paper called &ldquo;The World,&rdquo; on the other hand, was
      by &ldquo;our first writers.&rdquo; Who, then, were the first writers of England in
      the year 1758? Walpole has told us in a note. Our readers will probably
      guess that Hume, Fielding, Smollett, Richardson, Johnson, Warburton,
      Collins, Akenside, Gray, Dyer, Young, Warton, Mason, or some of those
      distinguished men, were in the list. Not one of them. Our first writers,
      it seems, were Lord Chesterfield, Lord Bath, Mr. W. Whithed, Sir Charles
      Williams, Mr. Soame Jenyns, Mr. Cambridge, Mr. Coventry. Of these seven
      personages, Whithed was the lowest in station, but was the most
      accomplished tuft-hunter of his time. Coventry was of a noble family. The
      other five had among them two seats in the House of Lords, two seats in
      the House of Commons, three seats in the Privy Council, a baronetcy, a
      blue riband, a red riband, about a hundred thousand pounds a year, and not
      ten pages that are worth reading. The writings of Whithed, Cambridge,
      Coventry, and Lord Bath are forgotten. Soame Jenyns is remembered chiefly
      by Johnson&rsquo;s review of the foolish Essay on the Origin of Evil. Lord
      Chesterfield stands much lower in the estimation of posterity than he
      would have done if his letters had never been published. The lampoons of
      Sir Charles Williams are now read only by the curious, and, though not
      without occasional flashes of wit, have always seemed to us, we must own,
      very poor performances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walpole judged of French literature after the same fashion. He understood
      and loved the French language. Indeed, he loved it too well. His style is
      more deeply tainted with Gallicism than that of any other English writer
      with whom we are acquainted. <span class="pagenum">153</span><a
      name="link153" id="link153"></a>His composition often reads, for a page
      together, like a rude translation from the French. We meet every minute
      with such sentences as these, &ldquo;One knows what temperaments Annibal Caracci
      painted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The impertinent personage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is dead rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Dalkeith is dead of the small-pox in three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not be seen whether he or they are most patriot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His love of the French language was of a peculiar kind. He loved it as
      having been for a century the vehicle of all the polite nothings of
      Europe, as the sign by which the freemasons of fashion recognised each
      other in every capital from Petersburg to Naples, as the language of
      raillery, as the language of anecdote, as the language of memoirs, as the
      language of correspondence. Its higher uses he altogether disregarded. The
      literature of France has been to ours what Aaron was to Moses, the
      expositor of great truths which would else have perished for want of a
      voice to utter them with distinctness. The relation which existed between
      Mr. Bentham and M. Dumont is an exact illustration of the intellectual
      relation in which the two countries stand to each other. The great
      discoveries in physics, in metaphysics, in political science, are ours.
      But scarcely any foreign nation except France has received them from us,
      by direct communication. Isolated by our situation, isolated by our
      manners, we found truth, but we did not impart it. France has been the
      interpreter between England and mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time of Walpole, this process of interpretation was in full
      activity. The great French writers were busy in proclaiming through Europe
      the names of Bacon, of Newton, and of Locke. The English <span
      class="pagenum">154</span><a name="link154" id="link154"></a>principles of
      toleration, the English respect for personal liberty, the English doctrine
      that all power is a trust for the public good, were making rapid progress.
      There is scarcely any thing in history so interesting as that great
      stirring up of the mind of France, that shaking of the foundations of all
      established opinions, that uprooting of old truth and old error. It was
      plain that mighty principles were at work whether for evil or for good. It
      was plain that a great change in the whole social system was at hand.
      Fanatics of one kind might anticipate a golden age, in which men should
      live under the simple dominion of reason, in perfect equality and perfect
      amity, without property, or marriage, or king, or God. A fanatic of
      another kind might see nothing in the doctrines of the philosophers but
      anarchy and atheism, might cling more closely to every old abuse, and
      might regret the good old days when St. Dominic and Simon de Montfort put
      down the growing heresies of Provence. A wise man would have seen with
      regret the excesses into which the reformers were running; but he would
      have done justice to their genius and to their philanthropy. He would have
      censured their errors; but he would have remembered that, as Milton has
      said, error is but opinion in the making. While he condemned their
      hostility to religion, he would have acknowledged that it was the natural
      effect of a system under which religion had been constantly exhibited to
      them in forms which common sense rejected and at which humanity shuddered.
      While he condemned some of their political doctrines as incompatible with
      all law, all property, and all civilisation, he would have acknowledged
      that the subjects of Lewis the Fifteenth had every excuse which men could
      have for being eager to pull down, <span class="pagenum">155</span><a
      name="link155" id="link155"></a>and for being ignorant of the far higher
      art of setting up. While anticipating a fierce conflict, a great and
      wide-wasting destruction, he would yet have looked forward to the final
      close with a good hope for France and for mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walpole had neither hopes nor fears. Though the most Frenchified English
      writer of the eighteenth century, he troubled himself little about the
      portents which were daily to be discerned in the French literature of his
      time. While the most eminent Frenchmen were studying with enthusiastic
      delight English politics and English philosophy, he was studying as
      intently the gossip of the old court of France. The fashions and scandal
      of Versailles and Marli, fashions and scandal a hundred years old,
      occupied him infinitely more than a great moral revolution which was
      taking place in his sight. He took a prodigious interest in every noble
      sharper whose vast volume of wig and infinite length of riband had figured
      at the dressing or at the tucking up of Lewis the Fourteenth, and of every
      profligate woman of quality who had carried her train of lovers backward
      and forward from king to parliament, and from parliament to king during
      the wars of the Fronde. These were the people of whom he treasured up the
      smallest memorial, of whom he loved to hear the most trifling anecdote,
      and for whose likenesses he would have given any price. Of the great
      French writers of his own time, Montesquieu is the only one of whom he
      speaks with enthusiasm. And even of Montesquieu he speaks with less
      enthusiasm than of that abject thing, Crébillon the younger, a scribbler
      as licentious as Louvet and as dull as Rapin. A man must be strangely
      constituted who can take interest in pedantic journals of the blockades
      laid by the Duke of A. to the hearts <span class="pagenum">156</span><a
      name="link156" id="link156"></a>of the Marquise de B. and the Comtesse de
      C. This trash Walpole extols in language sufficiently high for the merits
      of Don Quixote. He wished to possess a likeness of Crebillon; and Liotard,
      the first painter of miniatures then living, was employed to preserve the
      features of the profligate dunce. The admirer of the <i>Sopha</i> and of
      the <i>Lettres Athéniennes</i> had little respect to spare for the men who
      were then at the head of French literature. He kept carefully out of their
      way. He tried to keep other people from paying them any attention. He
      could not deny that Voltaire and Rousseau were clever men; but he took
      every opportunity of depreciating them. Of D&rsquo;Alembert he spoke with a
      contempt which, when the intellectual powers of the two men are compared,
      seems exquisitely ridiculous. D&rsquo;Alembert complained that he was accused of
      having written Walpole&rsquo;s squib against Rousseau. &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; says Walpole,
      &ldquo;that nobody will attribute D&rsquo;Alembert&rsquo;s works to me.&rdquo; He was in little
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to deny, however, that Walpole&rsquo;s writings have real
      merit, and merit of a very rare, though not of a very high kind. Sir
      Joshua Reynolds used to say that, though nobody would for a moment compare
      Claude to Raphael, there would be another Raphael before there was another
      Claude. And we own that we expect to see fresh Humes and fresh Burkes
      before we again fall in with that peculiar combination of moral and
      intellectual qualities to which the writings of Walpole owe their
      extraordinary popularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to describe him by negatives. He had not a creative
      imagination. He had not a pure taste. He was not a great reasoner. There
      is indeed scarcely any writer in whose works it would be possible to find
      <span class="pagenum">157</span><a name="link157" id="link157"></a>so many
      contradictory judgments, so many sentences of extravagant nonsense. Nor
      was it only in his familiar correspondence that he wrote in this flighty
      and inconsistent manner, but in long and elaborate books, in books
      repeatedly transcribed and intended for the public eye. We will give an
      instance or two; for without instances, readers not very familiar with his
      works will scarcely understand our meaning. In the Anecdotes of Painting,
      he states, very truly, that the art declined after the commencement of the
      civil wars. He proceeds to inquire why this happened. The explanation, we
      should have thought, would have been easily found. He might have mentioned
      the loss of a king who was the most munificent and judicious patron that
      the fine arts have ever had in England, the troubled state of the country,
      the distressed condition of many of the aristocracy, perhaps also the
      austerity of the victorious party. These circumstances, we conceive, fully
      account for the phænomenon. But this solution was not odd enough to
      satisfy Walpole. He discovers another cause for the decline of the art,
      the want of models. Nothing worth painting, it seems, was left to paint.
      &ldquo;How picturesque,&rdquo; he exclaims, &ldquo;was the figure of an Anabaptist!&rdquo;&mdash;as
      if puritanism had put out the sun and withered the trees; as if the civil
      wars had blotted out the expression of character and passion from the
      human lip and brow; as if many of the men whom Vandyke painted had not
      been living in the time of the Commonwealth, with faces little the worse
      for wear; as if many of the beauties afterwards portrayed by Lely were not
      in their prime before the Restoration; as if the garb or the features of
      Cromwell and Milton were less picturesque than those of the round-faced
      peers, as like each other as <span class="pagenum">158</span><a
      name="link158" id="link158"></a>eggs to eggs, who look out from the middle
      of the periwigs of Kneller. In the Memoirs, again, Walpole sneers at the
      Prince of Wales, afterwards George the Third, for presenting a collection
      of books to one of the American colleges during the Seven Years&rsquo; War, and
      says that, instead of books, His Royal Highness ought to have sent arms
      and ammunition; as if a war ought to suspend all study and all education;
      or as if it was the business of the Prince of Wales to supply the colonies
      with military stores out of his own pocket. We have perhaps dwelt too long
      on these passages; but we have done so because they are specimens of
      Walpole&rsquo;s manner. Everybody who reads his works with attention, will find
      that they swarm with loose, and foolish observations like those which we
      have cited; observations which might pass in conversation or in a hasty
      letter, but which are unpardonable in books deliberately written and
      repeatedly corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He appears to have thought that he saw very far into men; but we are under
      the necessity of altogether dissenting from his opinion. We do not
      conceive that he had any power of discerning the finer shades of
      character. He practised an art, however, which, though easy and even
      vulgar, obtains for those who practise it the reputation of discernment
      with ninety-nine people out of a hundred. He sneered at everybody, put on
      every action the worst construction which it would bear, &ldquo;spelt every man
      backward,&rdquo; to borrow the Lady Hero&rsquo;s phrase, <br /><br /><span
      class="indent25">"Turned every man the wrong side out, <br /><span
      class="indent20">And never gave to truth and virtue that <br /><span
      class="indent20">Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.&rdquo; </span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way any man may, with little sagacity and little <span
      class="pagenum">159</span><a name="link159" id="link159"></a>trouble, be
      considered by those whose good opinion is not worth having as a great
      judge of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that the hasty and rapacious Kneller used to send away the
      ladies who sate to him as soon as he had sketched their faces, and to
      paint the figure and hands from his housemaid. It was in much the same way
      that Walpole portrayed the minds of others. He copied from the life only
      those glaring and obvious peculiarities which could not escape the most
      superficial observation. The rest of the canvas he filled up, in a
      careless dashing way, with knave and fool, mixed in such proportions as
      pleased Heaven. What a difference between these daubs and the masterly
      portraits of Clarendon.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are contradictions without end in the sketches of character which
      abound in Walpole&rsquo;s works. But if we were to form our opinion of his
      eminent contemporaries from a general survey of what he has written
      concerning them, we should say that Pitt was a strutting, ranting,
      mouthing actor, Charles Townshend an impudent and voluble jack-pudding,
      Murray a demure, cold-blooded, cowardly hypocrite, Hardwicke an insolent
      upstart, with the understanding of a pettifogger and the heart of a
      hangman, Temple an impertinent poltroon, Egmont a solemn coxcomb,
      Lyttelton a poor creature whose only wish was to go to heaven in a
      coronet, Onslow a pompous proser, Washington a braggart, Lord Camden
      sullen, Lord Townshend malevolent, Seeker an atheist who had shammed
      Christian for a mitre, Whitefield an impostor who swindled his converts
      out of their watches. The Walpoles fare little better than their
      neighbours. Old Horace is constantly represented as a coarse, brutal,
      niggardly buffoon, and his son as worthy of such a father. In short, <span
      class="pagenum">160</span><a name="link160" id="link160"></a>if we are to
      trust this discerning judge of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      England in his time contained little sense and no virtue, except what was
      distributed between himself, Lord Waldgrave, and Marshal Conway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of such a writer it is scarcely necessary to say, that his works are
      destitute of every charm which is derived from elevation or from
      tenderness of sentiment. When he chose to be humane, and magnanimous,&mdash;for
      he sometimes, by way of variety, tried this affectation,&mdash;he overdid
      his part most ludicrously. None of his many disguises sat so awkwardly
      upon him. For example, he tells us that he did not choose to be intimate
      with Mr. Pitt. And why? Because Mr. Pitt had been among the persecutors of
      his father? Or because, as he repeatedly assures us, Mr. Pitt was a
      disagreeable man in private life? Not at all; but because Mr. Pitt was too
      fond of war, and was great with too little reluctance. Strange that a
      habitual scoffer like Walpole should imagine that this cant could impose
      on the dullest reader! If Molière had put such a speech into the mouth of
      Tartuffe, we should have said that the fiction was unskilful, and that
      Orgon could not have been such a fool as to be taken in by it. Of the
      twenty-six years during which Walpole sat in Parliament, thirteen were
      years of war. Yet he did not, during all those thirteen years, utter a
      single word or give a single vote tending to peace. His most intimate
      friend, the only friend, indeed, to whom he appears to have been sincerely
      attached, Conway, was a soldier, was fond of his profession, and was
      perpetually entreating Mr. Pitt to give him employment. In this Walpole
      saw nothing but what was admirable. Conway was a hero for soliciting the
      command of expeditions which Mr. Pitt was a monster for sending out. <span
      class="pagenum">161</span><a name="link161" id="link161"></a>What than is
      the charm, the irresistible charm, of Walpole&rsquo;s writings? It consists, we
      think, in the art of amusing without exciting. He never convinces the
      reason, or fills the imagination, or touches the heart; but he keeps the
      mind of the reader constantly attentive and constantly entertained. He had
      a strange ingenuity peculiarly his own, an ingenuity which appeared in all
      that he did, in his building, in his gardening, in his upholstery, in the
      matter and in the manner of his writings. If we were to adopt the
      classification, not a very accurate classification, which Akenside has
      given of the pleasures of the imagination, we should say that with the
      Sublime and the Beautiful Walpole had nothing to do, but that the third
      province, the Odd, was his peculiar domain. The motto which he prefixed to
      his Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors might have been inscribed with
      perfect propriety over the door of every room in his house, and on the
      title-page of every one of his books; &ldquo;Dove diavolo, Messer Ludovico,
      avete pigliate tante coglionerie?&rdquo; In his villa, every apartment is a
      museum; every piece of furniture is a curiosity: there is something
      strange in the form of the shovel; there is a long story belonging to the
      bell-rope. We wander among a profusion of rarities, of trifling intrinsic
      value, but so quaint in fashion, or connected with such remarkable names
      and events, that they may well detain our attention for a moment. A moment
      is enough. Some new relic, some new unique, some new carved work, some new
      enamel, is forthcoming in an instant. One cabinet of trinkets is no sooner
      closed than another is opened. It is the same with Walpole&rsquo;s writings. It
      is not in their utility, it is not in their beauty, that their attraction
      lies. They are to the works of great historians <span class="pagenum">162</span><a
      name="link162" id="link162"></a>and poets, what Strawberry Hill is to the
      Museum of Sir Hans Sloane or to the Gallery of Florence. Walpole is
      constantly showing us things, not of very great value indeed, yet things
      which we are pleased to see, and which we can see nowhere else. They are
      baubles; but they are made curiosities either by his grotesque workmanship
      or by some association belonging to them. His style is one of those
      peculiar styles by which every body is attracted, and which nobody can
      safely venture to imitate. He is a mannerist whose manner has become
      perfectly easy to him. His affectation is so habitual and so universal
      that it can hardly be called affectation. The affectation is the essence
      of the man. It pervades all his thoughts and all his expressions. If it
      were taken away, nothing would be left. He coins new words, distorts the
      senses of old words, and twists sentences into forms which make
      grammarians stare. But all this he does, not only with an air of ease, but
      as if he could not help doing it. His wit was, in its essential
      properties, of the same kind with that of Cowley and Donne. Like theirs,
      it consisted in an exquisite perception of points of anal-ogv and points
      of contrast too subtile for common observation. Like them, Walpole
      perpetually startles us by the ease with which he yokes together ideas
      between which there would seem, at first sight, to be no connection. But
      he did not, like them, affect the gravity of a lecture, and draw his
      illustrations from the laboratory and from the schools. His tone was light
      and fleeting; his topics were the topics of the club and the ball-room;
      and therefore his strange combinations and far-fetched allusions, though
      very closely resembling those which tire us to death in the poems of the
      time of Charles the First, are read with pleasure constantly new. <span
      class="pagenum">163</span><a name="link163" id="link163"></a>No man who
      has written so much is so seldom tiresome. In his books there are scarcely
      any of those passages which, in our school days, we used to call <i>skip</i>.
      Yet he often wrote on subjects which are generally considered as dull, on
      subjects which men of great talents have in vain endeavoured to render
      popular. When we compare the Historic Doubts about Richard the Third with
      Whitaker&rsquo;s and Chalmers&rsquo;s books on a far more interesting question, the
      character of Mary Queen of Scots; when we compare the Anecdotes of
      Painting with the works of Anthony Wood, of Nichols, of Granger, we at
      once see Walpole&rsquo;s superiority, not in industry, not in learning, not in
      accuracy, not in logical power, but in the art of writing what people will
      like to read. He rejects all but the attractive parts of his subject. He
      keeps only what is in itself amusing, or what can be made so by the
      artifice of his diction. The coarser morsels of antiquarian learning he
      abandons to others, and sets out an entertainment worthy of a Roman
      epicure, an entertainment consisting of nothing but delicacies, the brains
      of singing birds, the roe of mullets, the sunny halves of peaches. This,
      we think, is the great merit of his romance. There is little skill in the
      delineation of the characters. Manfred is as commonplace a tyrant, Jerome
      as commonplace a confessor, Theodore as commonplace a young gentleman,
      Isabella and Matilda as commonplace a pair of young ladies, as are to be
      found in any of the thousand Italian castles in which <i>condottieri</i>
      have revelled or in which imprisoned duchesses have pined. We cannot say
      that we much admire the big man whose sword is dug up in one quarter of
      the globe, whose helmet drops from the clouds in another, and who, after
      clattering and rustling; <span class="pagenum">164</span><a name="link164"
       id="link164"></a>for some days, ends by kicking the house down. But the
      story, whatever its value may be, never flags for a single moment. There
      are no digressions, or unseasonable descriptions, or long speeches. Every
      sentence carries the action forward. The excitement is constantly renewed.
      Absurd as is the machinery, insipid as are the human actors, no reader
      probably ever thought the book dull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walpole&rsquo;s letters are generally considered as his best, performances, and,
      we think, with reason. His faults are far less offensive to us in his
      correspondence than in his books. His wild, absurd, and ever-changing
      opinions about men and things are easily pardoned in familiar letters. His
      bitter, scoffing, depreciating disposition does not show itself in so
      unmitigated a manner as in his Memoirs. A writer of letters must in
      general be civil and friendly to his correspondent at least, if to no
      other person.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loved letter-writing, and had evidently studied it as an art. It was,
      in truth, the very kind of writing for such a man, for a man very
      ambitious to rank among wits, yet nervously afraid that, while obtaining
      the reputation of a wit, he might lose caste as a gentleman. There was
      nothing vulgar in writing a letter. Not even Ensign Northerton, not even
      the Captain described in Hamilton&rsquo;s Bawn,&mdash;and Walpole, though the
      author of many quartos, had some feelings in common with those gallant
      officers,&mdash;would have denied that a gentleman might sometimes
      correspond with a friend. Whether Walpole bestowed much labour on the
      composition of his letters, it is impossible to judge from internal
      evidence. There are passages which seem perfectly unstudied. But the
      appearance of ease may be the effect of labour. There are passages which
      have a very <span class="pagenum">165</span><a name="link165" id="link165"></a>artificial
      air. But they may have been produced without effort by a mind of which the
      natural ingenuity had been improved into morbid quickness by constant
      exercise. We are never sure that we see him as he was. We are never sure
      that what appears to be nature is not disguised art. We are never sure
      that what appears to be art is not merely habit which has become second
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In wit and animation the present collection is not superior to those which
      have preceded it. But it has one great advantage over them all. It forms a
      connected whole, a regular journal of what appeared to Walpole the most
      important transactions of the last twenty years of George the Second&rsquo;s
      reign. It furnishes much new information concerning the history of that
      time, the portion of English history of which common readers know the
      least.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earlier letters contain the most lively and interesting account which
      we possess of that &ldquo;great Walpolean battle,&rdquo; to use the words of Junius,
      which terminated in the retirement of Sir Robert. Horace entered the House
      of Commons just in time to witness the last desperate struggle which his
      father, surrounded by enemies and traitors, maintained, with a spirit as
      brave as that of the column of Fontenoy, first for victory, and then for
      honourable retreat. Horace was, of course, on the side of his family. Lord
      Dover seems to have been enthusiastic on the same side, and goes so far as
      to call Sir Robert &ldquo;the glory of the Whigs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert deserved this high eulogium, we think, as little as he deserved
      the abusive epithets which have often been coupled with his name. A fair
      character of him still remains to be drawn; and, whenever it shall be
      drawn, it will be equally unlike the portrait by Coxe and the portrait by
      Smollett. <span class="pagenum">166</span><a name="link166" id="link166"></a>He
      had, undoubtedly, great talents and great virtues. He was not, indeed,
      like the leaders of the party which opposed his government, a brilliant
      orator. He was not a profound scholar, like Carteret, or a wit and a fine
      gentleman, like Chesterfield. In all these respects his deficiencies were
      remarkable. His literature consisted of a scrap or two of Horace and an
      anecdote or two from the end of the Dictionary. His knowledge of history
      was so limited that, in the great debate on the Excise Bill, he was forced
      to ask Attorney-General Yorke who Empson and Dudley were. His manners were
      a little too coarse and boisterous even for that age of Westerns and
      Topehalls. When he ceased to talk of politics, he could talk of nothing
      but women; and he dilated on his favourite theme with a freedom which
      shocked even that plain-spoken generation, and which was quite unsuited to
      his age and station. The noisy revelry of his summer festivities at
      Houghton gave much scandal to grave people, and annually drove his kinsman
      and colleague, Lord Townshend, from the neighbouring mansion of Rainham.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, however ignorant Walpole might be of general history and of general
      literature, he was better acquainted than any man of his day with what it
      concerned him most to know, mankind, the English nation, the Court, the
      House of Commons, and the Treasury. Of foreign affairs he knew little; but
      his judgment was so good that his little knowledge went very far. He was
      an excellent parliamentary debater, an excellent parliamentary tactician,
      an excellent man of business. No man ever brought more industry or more
      method to the transacting of affairs. No minister in his time did so much;
      yet no minister had so much leisure. <span class="pagenum">167</span><a
      name="link167" id="link167"></a>He was a good-natured man who had during
      thirty years seen nothing but the worst parts of human nature in other
      men. He was familiar with the malice of kind people, and the perfidy of
      honourable people. Proud men had licked the dust before him. Patriots had
      begged him to come up to the price of their puffed and advertised
      integrity. He said after his fall that it was a dangerous thing to be a
      minister, that there were few minds which would not be injured by the
      constant spectacle of meanness and depravity. To his honour it must be
      confessed that few minds have come out of such a trial so little damaged
      in the most important parts. He retired, after more than twenty years of
      supreme power, with a temper not soured, with a heart not hardened, with
      simple tastes, with frank manners, and with a capacity for friendship. No
      stain of treachery, of ingratitude, or of cruelty rests on his memory.
      Factious hatred, while flinging on his name every other foul aspersion,
      was compelled to own that he was not a man of blood. This would scarcely
      seem a high eulogium on a statesman of our times. It was then a rare and
      honourable distinction. The contests of parties in England had long been
      carried on with a ferocity unworthy of a civilised people. Sir Robert
      Walpole was the minister who gave to our Government that character of
      lenity which it has since generally preserved. It was perfectly known to
      him that many of his opponents had dealings with the Pretender. The lives
      of some were at his mercy. He wanted neither Whig nor Tory precedents for
      using his advantage unsparingly. But with a clemency to which posterity
      has never done justice, he suffered himself to be thwarted, vilified, and
      at last overthrown, by a party which included many men whose necks were in
      his power. <span class="pagenum">168</span><a name="link168" id="link168"></a>That
      he practised corruption on a large scale is, we think, indisputable. But
      whether he deserves all the invectives which have been uttered against him
      on that account may be questioned. No man ought to be severely censured
      for not being beyond his age in virtue. To buy the votes of constituents
      is as immoral as to buy the votes of representatives. The candidate who
      gives five guineas to the freeman is as culpable as the man who gives
      three hundred guineas to the member. Yet we know, that, in our time, no
      man is thought wicked or dishonourable, no man is cut, no man is
      black-balled, because, under the old system of election, he was returned
      in the only way in which he could be returned, for East Retford, for
      Liverpool, or for Stafford. Walpole governed by corruption, because, in
      his time, it was impossible to govern otherwise. Corruption was
      unnecessary to the Tudors; for their Parliaments were feeble. The
      publicity which has of late years been given to parliamentary proceedings
      has raised the standard of morality among public men. The power of public
      opinion is so great that, even before the reform of the representation, a
      faint suspicion that a minister had given pecuniary gratifications to
      Members of Parliament in return for their votes would have been enough to
      ruin him. But, during the century which followed the Restoration, the
      House of Commons was in that situation in which assemblies must be managed
      by corruption, or cannot be managed at all. It was not held in awe as in
      the sixteenth century, by the throne. It was not held in awe as in the
      nineteenth century, by the opinion of the people. Its constitution was
      oligarchical. Its deliberations were secret. Its power in the State was
      immense. The Government had every conceivable motive to offer <span
      class="pagenum">169</span><a name="link169" id="link169"></a>bribes. Many
      of the members, if they were not men of strict honour and probity, had no
      conceivable motive to refuse what the Government offered. In the reign of
      Charles the Second, accordingly, the practice of buying votes in the House
      of Commons was commenced by the daring Clifford, and carried to a great
      extent by the crafty and shameless Danby. The Revolution, great and
      manifold as were the blessings of which it was directly or remotely the
      cause, at first aggravated this evil. The importance of the House of
      Commons was now greater than ever. The prerogatives of the Crown were more
      strictly limited than ever; and those associations in which, more than in
      its legal prerogatives, its power had consisted, were completely broken.
      No prince was ever in so helpless and distressing a situation as William
      the Third. The party which defended his title was, on general grounds,
      disposed to curtail his prerogative. The party which was, on general
      grounds, friendly to prerogative, was adverse to his title. There was no
      quarter in which both his office and his person could find favour. But
      while the influence of the House of Commons in the Government was becoming
      paramount, the influence of the people over the House of Commons was
      declining. It mattered little in the time of Charles the First whether
      that House were or were not chosen by the people; it was certain to act
      for the people, because it would have been at the mercy of the Court but
      for the support of the people. Now that the Court was at the mercy of the
      House of Commons, those members who were not returned by popular elections
      had nobody to please but themselves. Even those who were returned by
      popular election did not live, as now, under a constant sense of
      responsibility. The constituents were not, as now, daily apprised <span
      class="pagenum">170</span><a name="link170" id="link170"></a>of the votes
      and speeches of their representatives. The privileges which had in old
      times been indispensably necessary to the security and efficiency of
      Parliaments were now superfluous. But they were still carefully
      maintained, by honest legislators from superstitious veneration, by
      dishonest legislators for their own selfish ends. They had been an useful
      defence to the Commons during a long and doubtful conflict with powerful
      sovereigns. They were now no longer necessary for that purpose; and they
      became a defence to the members against their constituents. That secrecy
      which had been absolutely necessary in times when the Privy Council was in
      the habit of sending the leaders of Opposition to the Tower was preserved
      in times when a vote of the House of Commons was sufficient to hurl the
      most powerful minister from his post.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Government could not go on unless the Parliament could be kept in
      order. And how was the Parliament to be kept in order? Three hundred years
      ago it would have been enough for a statesman to have the support of the
      Crown. It would now, we hope and believe, be enough for him to enjoy the
      confidence and approbation of the great body of the middle class. A
      hundred years ago it would not have been enough to have both Crown and
      people on his side. The Parliament had shaken off the control of the Royal
      prerogative. It had not yet fallen under the control of public opinion. A
      large proportion of the members had absolutely no motive to support any
      administration except their own interest, in the lowest sense of the word.
      Under these circumstances, the country could be governed only by
      corruption. Bolingbroke, who was the ablest and the most vehement of those
      who raised the clamour against corruption, had no better remedy to <span
      class="pagenum">171</span><a name="link171" id="link171"></a>propose than
      that the Royal prerogative should be strengthened. The remedy would no
      doubt have been efficient. The only question is, whether it would not have
      been worse than the disease. The fault was in the constitution of the
      Legislature; and to blame those ministers who managed the Legislature in
      the only way in which it could be managed is gross injustice. They
      submitted to extortion because they could not help themselves. We might as
      well accuse the poor Lowland farmers who paid black mail to Rob Roy of
      corrupting the virtue of the Highlanders, as accuse Sir Robert Walpole of
      corrupting the virtue of Parliament. His crime was merely this, that he
      employed his money more dexterously, and got more support in return for
      it, than any of those who preceded or followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was himself incorruptible by money. His dominant passion was the love
      of power: and the heaviest charge which can be brought against him is that
      to this passion he never scrupled to sacrifice the interests of his
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the maxims which, as his son tells us, he was most in the habit of
      repeating, was, <i>quieta non movere</i>. It was indeed the maxim by which
      he generally regulated his public conduct. It is the maxim of a man more
      solicitous to hold power long than to use it well. It is remarkable that,
      though he was at the head of affairs during more than twenty years, not
      one great measure, not one important change for the better or for the
      worse in any part of our institutions, marks the period of his supremacy.
      Nor was this because he did not clearly see that many changes were very
      desirable. He had been brought up in the school of toleration, at the feet
      of Somers and of Burnet. He disliked the shameful laws against Dissenters.
      But he never could <span class="pagenum">172</span><a name="link172"
       id="link172"></a>be induced to bring forward a proposition for repealing
      them. The sufferers represented to him the injustice with which they were
      treated, boasted of their firm attachment to the House of Brunswick and to
      the Whig party, and reminded him of his own repeated declarations of good
      will to their cause. He listened, assented, promised, and did nothing. At
      length, the question was brought forward by others, and the Minister,
      after a hesitating and evasive speech, voted against it. The truth was
      that he remembered to the latest day of his life that terrible explosion
      of high-church feeling which the foolish prosecution of a foolish parson
      had occasioned in the days of Queen Anne. If the Dissenters had been
      turbulent he would probably have relieved them: but while he apprehended
      no danger from them, he would not run the slightest risk for their sake.
      He acted in the same manner with respect to other questions. He knew the
      state of the Scotch Highlands. He was constantly predicting another
      insurrection in that part of the empire. Yet, during his long tenure of
      power, he never attempted to perform what was then the most obvious and
      pressing duty of a British Statesman, to break the power of the Chiefs,
      and to establish the authority of law through the furthest corners of the
      Island. Nobody knew better than he that, if this were not done, great
      mischiefs would follow. But the Highlands were tolerably quiet in his
      time. He was content to meet daily emergencies by daily expedients; and he
      left the rest to his successors. They had to conquer the Highlands in the
      midst of a war with France and Spain, because he had not regulated the
      Highlands in a time of profound peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, in spite of all his caution, he found that measures which he
      had hoped to carry through quietly <span class="pagenum">173</span><a
      name="link173" id="link173"></a>had caused great agitation. When this was
      the case he generally modified or withdrew them. It was thus that he
      cancelled Wood&rsquo;s patent in compliance with the absurd outcry of the Irish.
      It was thus that he frittered away the Porteous Bill to nothing, for fear
      of exasperating the Scotch. It was thus that he abandoned the Excise Bill,
      as soon as he found that it was offensive to all the great towns of
      England. The language which he held about that measure in a subsequent
      session is strikingly characteristic. Pulteney had insinuated that the
      scheme would be again brought forward. &ldquo;As to the wicked scheme,&rdquo; said
      Walpole, &ldquo;as the gentleman is pleased to call it, which he would persuade
      gentlemen is not yet laid aside, I for my part assure this House I am not
      so mad as ever again to engage in any thing that looks like an Excise;
      though, in my private opinion, I still think it was a scheme that would
      have tended very much to the interest of the nation.&rdquo; The conduct of
      Walpole with regard to the Spanish war is the great blemish of his public
      life. Archdeacon Coxe imagined that he had discovered one grand principle
      of action to which the whole public conduct of his hero ought to be
      referred. &ldquo;Did the administration of Walpole,&rdquo; says the biographer,
      &ldquo;present any uniform principle which may be traced in every part, and
      which gave combination and consistency to the whole? Yes, and that
      principle was, The Love; of Peace.&rdquo; It would be difficult, we think, to
      bestow a higher eulogium on any statesman. But the enlogimn is far too
      high for the merits of Walpole. The great ruling principle of his public
      conduct was indeed a love of peace, but not in the sense in which
      Archdeacon Coxe uses the phrase. The peace which Walpole sought was not
      the peace of the country, but the peace <span class="pagenum">174</span><a
      name="link174" id="link174"></a>of his own administration. During the
      greater part of his public life, indeed, the two objects were inseparably
      connected. At length he was reduced to the necessity of choosing between
      them, of plunging the State into hostilities for which there was no just
      ground, and by which nothing was to be got, or of facing a violent
      opposition in the country, in Parliament, and even in the royal closet. No
      person was more thoroughly convinced than he of the absurdity of the cry
      against Spain. But his darling power was at stake, and his choice was soon
      made. He preferred an unjust war to a stormy session. It is impossible to
      say of a Minister who acted thus that the love of peace was the one grand
      principle to which all his conduct is to be referred. The governing
      principle of his conduct was neither love of peace nor love of war, but
      love of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The praise to which he is fairly entitled is this, that he understood the
      tine interest of his country better than any of his contemporaries, and
      that he pursued that interest whenever it was not incompatible with the
      interests of his own intense and grasping ambition. It was only in matters
      of public moment that he shrank from agitation and had recourse to
      compromise. In his contests for personal influence there was no timidity,
      no flinching. He would have all or none. Every member of the Government
      who would not submit to his ascendency was turned out or forced to resign.
      Liberal of every thing else, he was avaricious of powers Cautious
      everywhere else, when power was at stake he had all the boldness of
      Richelieu or Chatham. He might easily have secured his authority if he
      could have been induced to divide it with others. But he would not part
      with one fragment of it to purchase defenders for all the rest. The effect
      of this policy <span class="pagenum">175</span><a name="link175"
       id="link175"></a>was that he had able enemies and feeble allies. His most
      distinguished coadjutors left him one by one, and joined the ranks of the
      Opposition. He faced the increasing array of his enemies with unbroken
      spirit, and thought it far better that they should attack his power than
      that they should share it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Opposition was In every sense formidable. At its head were two royal
      personages, the exiled head of the House of Stuart, the disgraced heir of
      the House of Brunswick. One set of members received directions from
      Avignon. Another set held their consultations and banquets at Norfolk
      House. The majority of the landed gentry, the majority of the parochial
      clergy, one of the universities, and a strong party in the City of London
      and in the other great towns, were decidedly adverse to the Government. Of
      the men of letters, some were exasperated by the neglect with which the
      Minister treated them, a neglect which was the more remarkable, because
      his predecessors, both Whig and Tory, had paid court with emulous
      munificence to the wits and the poets; others were honestly inflamed by
      party zeal; almost all lent their aid to the Opposition. In truth, all
      that was alluring to ardent and imaginative minds was on that side; old
      associations, new visions of political improvement, high-flown theories of
      loyalty, high-flown theories of liberty, the enthusiasm of the Cavalier,
      the enthusiasm of the Roundhead. The Tory gentleman, fed in the
      common-rooms of Oxford with the doctrines of Filmer and Sacheverell, and
      proud of the exploits of his great grandfather, who had charged with
      Rupert at Marston, who had held out the old manor-house against Fairfax,
      and who, after the King&rsquo;s return, had been set down for a Knight of the
      Royal Oak, flew to that section of the <span class="pagenum">176</span><a
      name="link176" id="link176"></a>opposition which, under pretence of
      assailing the existing administration, was in truth assailing the reigning
      dynasty. The young republican, fresh from his Livy and his Lucan, and
      glowing with admiration of Hampden, of Russell, and of Sydney, hastened
      with equal eagerness to those benches from which eloquent voices thundered
      nightly against the tyranny and perfidy of courts. So many young
      politicians were caught by these declamations that Sir Robert, in one of
      his best speeches, observed that the opposition consisted of three bodies,
      the Tories, the discontented Whigs, who were known by the name of the
      Patriots, and the Boys. In fact almost every young man of warm temper and
      lively imagination, whatever his political bias might be, was drawn into
      the party adverse to the Government; and some of the most distinguished
      among them, Pitt, for example, among public men, and Johnson, among men of
      letters, afterwards openly acknowledged their mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aspect of the Opposition, even while it was still a minority in the
      House of Commons, was very imposing. Among those who, in Parliament or out
      of Parliament, assailed the administration of Walpole, were Bolingbroke,
      Carteret, Chesterfield, Argyle, Pulteney, Wyndham, Doddington, Pitt,
      Lyttelton, Barnard, Pope, Swift, Gay, Arbutlmot, Fielding, Johnson,
      Thomson, Akenside, Glover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstance that the Opposition was divided into two parties,
      diametrically opposed to each other in political opinions, was long the
      safety of Walpole. It was at last his ruin. The leaders of the minority
      knew that it would be difficult for them to bring forward any important
      measure without producing an immediate schism in their party. It was with
      very <span class="pagenum">177</span><a name="link177" id="link177"></a>great
      difficulty that the Whigs in opposition had been induced to give a sullen
      and silent vote for the repeal of the Septennial Act. The Tories, on the
      other hand, could not be induced to support Pulteney&rsquo;s motion for an
      addition to the income of Prince Frederic. The two parties had cordially
      joined in calling out for a war with Spain; but they now had their war.
      Hatred of Walpole was almost the only feeling which was common to them. On
      this one point, therefore, they concentrated their whole strength. With
      gross ignorance, or gross dishonesty, they represented the Minister as the
      main grievance of the state. His dismissal, his punishment, would prove
      the certain cure for all the evils which the nation suffered. What was to
      be done after his fall, how misgovernment was to be prevented in future,
      were questions to which there were as many answers as there were noisy and
      ill-informed members of the Opposition. The only cry in which all could
      join was, &ldquo;Down with Walpole!&rdquo; So much did they narrow the disputed
      ground, so purely personal did they make the question, that they threw out
      friendly hints to the other members of the Administration, and declared
      that they refused quarter to the Prime Minister alone. His tools might
      keep their heads, their fortunes, even their places, if only the great
      father of corruption were given up to the just vengeance of the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the fate of Walpole&rsquo;s colleagues had been inseparably bound up with
      his, he probably would, even after the unfavourable elections of 1744,
      have been able to weather the storm. But as soon as it was understood that
      the attack was directed against him alone, and that, if he were
      sacrificed, his associates might expect advantageous and honourable terms,
      <span class="pagenum">178</span><a name="link178" id="link178"></a>the
      ministerial ranks began to waver, and the murmur of <i>sauve qui peat</i>
      was heard. That Walpole had foul play is almost certain, but to what
      extent it is difficult to say. Lord Islay was suspected; the Duke of
      Newcastle something more than suspected. It would have been strange,
      indeed, if his Grace had been idle when treason was hatching. <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">"Ch&rsquo; i&rsquo; ho de&rsquo; traditor&rsquo; sempre sospetto, <br /><span
      class="indent20">E Gan fu traditor prima che nato.&rdquo; </span></span>

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name,&rdquo; said Sir Robert, &ldquo;is perfidy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never was a battle more manfully fought out than the last struggle of the
      old statesman. His clear judgment, his long experience, and his fearless
      spirit, enabled him to maintain a defensive war through half the session.
      To the last his heart never failed him; and, when at last he yielded, he
      yielded not to the threats of his enemies, but to the entreaties of his
      dispirited and refractory followers. When he could no longer retain his
      power, he compounded for honour and security, and retired to his garden
      and his paintings, leaving to those who had overthrown him shame, discord,
      and ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every thing was in confusion. It has been said that the confusion was
      produced by the dexterous policy of Walpole; and, undoubtedly, he did his
      best to sow dissension amongst his triumphant enemies. Rut there was
      little for him to do. Victory had completely dissolved the hollow truce,
      which the two sections of the Opposition had but imperfectly observed,
      even while the event of the contest was still doubtful. A thousand
      questions were opened in a moment. A thousand conflicting claims were
      preferred. It was impossible to follow any line of policy which would not
      have been offensive to a large portion <span class="pagenum">179</span><a
      name="link179" id="link179"></a>of the successful party. It was impossible
      to find places for a tenth part of those who thought that they had a right
      to office. While the parliamentary leaders were preaching patience and
      confidence, while their followers were clamouring for reward, a still
      louder voice was heard from without, the terrible cry of a people angry,
      they hardly knew with whom, and impatient they hardly knew for what. The
      day of retribution had arrived. The Opposition reaped that which they had
      sown. Inflamed with hatred and cupidity, despairing of success by any
      ordinary mode of political warfare, and blind to consequences which,
      though remote, were certain, they had conjured up a devil whom they could
      not lay. They had made the public mind drunk with calumny and declamation.
      They had raised expectations which it was impossible to satisfy. The
      downfall of Walpole was to be the beginning of a political millennium; and
      every enthusiast had figured to himself that millennium according to the
      fashion of his own wishes. The republican expected that the power of the
      Crown would be reduced to a mere shadow, the high Tory that the Stuarts
      would be restored, the moderate Tory that the golden days which the Church
      and the landed interest had enjoyed during the last years of Queen Anne,
      would immediately return. It would have been impossible to satisfy
      everybody. The conquerors satisfied nobody We have no reverence for the
      memory of those who were then called the patriots. We are for the
      principles of good government against Walpole, and for Walpole against the
      Opposition. It was most desirable that a purer system should be
      introduced; but, if the old system was to be retained, no man was so fit
      as Walpole to be at the head of affairs. There <span class="pagenum">180</span><a
      name="link180" id="link180"></a>were grievous abuses in the government,
      abuses more than sufficient to justify a strong opposition. But the party
      opposed to Walpole, while they stimulated the popular fury to the highest
      point, were at no pains to direct it aright. Indeed they studiously
      misdirected it. They misrepresented the evil. They prescribed inefficient
      and pernicious remedies. They held up a single man as the sole cause of
      all the vices of a bad system which had been in full operation before his
      entrance into public life, and which continued to be in full operation
      when some of these very brawlers had succeeded to his power. They thwarted
      his best measures. They drove him into an unjustifiable war against his
      will. Constantly talking in magnificent language about tyranny,
      corruption, wicked ministers, servile courtiers, the liberty of
      Englishmen, the Great Charter, the rights for which our fathers bled,
      Timoleon, Brutus, Hampden, Sydney, they had absolutely nothing to propose
      which would have been an improvement on our institutions. Instead of
      directing the public mind to definite reforms which might have completed
      the work of the revolution, which might have brought the legislature into
      harmony with the nation, and which might have prevented the Crown from
      doing by influence what it could no longer do by prerogative, they excited
      a vague craving for change, by which they profited for a single moment,
      and of which, as they well deserved, they were soon the victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the reforms which the state then required, there were two of
      paramount importance, two which would alone have remedied almost every
      gross abuse, and without which all other remedies would have been
      unavailing, the publicity of parliamentary proceedings, and the abolition
      of the rotten boroughs. Neither of <span class="pagenum">181</span><a
      name="link181" id="link181"></a>these was thought of. It seems to us clear
      that, if these were not adopted, all other measures would have been
      illusory. Some of the patriots suggested changes which would, beyond all
      doubt, have increased the existing evils a hundred fold. These men wished
      to transfer the disposal of employments and the command of the army from
      the Crown to the Parliament; and this on the very ground that the
      Parliament had long been a grossly corrupt body. The security against
      malpractices was to be that the members, instead of having a portion of
      the public plunder doled out to them by a minister, were to help
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other schemes of which the public mind was full were less dangerous
      than this. Some of them were in themselves harmless. But none of them
      would have done much good, and most of them were extravagantly absurd.
      What they were we may learn from the instructions which many constituent
      bodies, immediately after the change of administration, sent up to their
      representatives. A more deplorable collection of follies can hardly be
      imagined. There is, in the first place, a general cry for Walpole&rsquo;s head.
      Then there are bitter complaints of the decay of trade, a decay which, in
      the judgment of these enlightened politicians, was brought about by
      Walpole and corruption. They would have been nearer to the truth if they
      had attributed their sufferings to the war into which they had driven
      Walpole against his better judgment. He had foretold the effects of his
      unwilling concession. On the day when hostilities against Spain were
      proclaimed, when the heralds were attended into the city by the chiefs of
      the Opposition, when the Prince of Wales himself stopped at Temple-Bar to
      drink success to the English arms, the Minister <span class="pagenum">182</span><a
      name="link182" id="link182"></a>heard all the steeples of the city
      jingling with a merry peal, and muttered, &ldquo;They may ring the bells now:
      they will be wringing their hands before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another grievance, for which of course Walpole and corruption were
      answerable, was the great exportation of English wool. In the judgment of
      the sagacious electors of several large towns, the remedying of this evil
      was a matter second only in importance, to the hanging of Sir Robert.
      There were also earnest injunctions that the members should vote against
      standing armies in time of peace, injunctions which were, to say the
      least, ridiculously unseasonable in the midst of a war which was likely to
      last, and which did actually last, as long as the Parliament. The repeal
      of the Septennial Act, as was to be expected, was strongly pressed.
      Nothing was more natural than that the voters should wish for a triennial
      recurrence of their bribes and their ale. We feel firmly convinced that
      the repeal of the Septennial Act, unaccompanied by a complete reform of
      the constitution of the elective body, would have been an unmixed curse to
      the country. The only rational recommendation which we can find in all
      these instructions is that the number of placemen in Parliament should be
      limited, and that pensioners should not be allowed to sit there. It is
      plain, however, that this cure was far from going to the root of the evil,
      and that, if it had been adopted without other reforms, secret bribery
      would probably have been more practised than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will give one more instance of the absurd expectations which the
      declamations of the Opposition had raised in the country. Akenside was one
      of the fiercest and most uncompromising of the young patriots <span
      class="pagenum">183</span><a name="link183" id="link183"></a>out of
      Parliament. When he found that the change of administration had produced
      no change of system, he gave vent to his indignation in the &ldquo;Epistle to
      Curio,&rdquo; the best poem that he ever wrote, a poem, indeed, which seems to
      indicate, that, if he had left lyric composition to Gray and Collins, and
      had employed his powers in grave and elevated satire, he might have
      disputed the preéminence of Dryden. But whatever be the literary merits of
      the epistle, we can say nothing in praise of the political doctrines which
      it inculcates. The poet, in a rapturous apostrophe to the spirits of the
      great men of antiquity, tells us what he expected from Pulteney at the
      moment of the fall of the tyrant. <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"See
      private life by wisest arts reclaimed, <br /><span class="indent20">See
      ardent youth to noblest manners framed, <br /><span class="indent20">See us
      achieve whate&rsquo;er was sought by you, <br /><span class="indent20">If Curio&mdash;only
      Curio&mdash;will be true.&rdquo; </span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Pulteney&rsquo;s business, it seems, to abolish faro and masquerades, to
      stint the young Duke of Marlborough to a bottle of brandy a day, and to
      prevail on Lady Vane to be content with three lovers at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the people wanted, they certainly got nothing. Walpole retired in
      safety; and the multitude were defrauded of the expected show on Tower
      Hill. The Septennial Act was not repealed. The placemen were not turned
      out of the House of Commons. Wool, we believe, was still exported.
      &ldquo;Private lift;&rdquo; afforded as much scandal as if the reign of Walpole and
      corruption had continued; and &ldquo;ardent youth&rdquo; fought with watchmen and
      betted with blacklegs as much as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colleagues of Walpole had, after his retreat, admitted some of the
      chiefs of the Opposition into the <span class="pagenum">184</span><a
      name="link184" id="link184"></a>Government, and soon found themselves
      compelled to submit to the ascendency of one of their new allies. This was
      Lord Carteret, afterwards Earl Granville. No public man of that age had
      greater courage, greater ambition, greater activity, greater talents for
      debate or for declamation. No public man had such profound and extensive
      learning. He was familiar with the ancient writers, and loved to sit up
      till midnight discussing philological and metrical questions with Bentley.
      His knowledge of modern languages was prodigious. The privy council, when
      he was present, needed no interpreter. He spoke and wrote French, Italian,
      Spanish, Portuguese, German, even Swedish. He had pushed his researches
      into the most obscure nooks of literature. He was as familiar with
      Canonists and Schoolmen as with orators and poets. He had read all that
      the universities of Saxony and Holland had produced on the most intricate
      questions of public law. Harte, in the preface to the second edition of
      his History of Gustavus Adolphus, bears a remarkable testimony to the
      extent and accuracy of Lord Carteret&rsquo;s knowledge. &ldquo;It was my good fortune
      or prudence to keep the main body of my army (or in other words my matters
      of fact) safe and entire. The late Earl of Granville was pleased to
      declare himself of this opinion; especially when he found that I had made
      Chemnitius one of my principal guides; for his Lordship was apprehensive I
      might not have seen that valuable and authentic book, which is extremely
      scarce. I thought myself happy to have contented his Lordship even in the
      lowest degree: for he understood the German and Swedish histories to the
      highest perfection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With all this learning, Carteret was far from being a pedant. His was not
      one of those cold spirits of which <span class="pagenum">185</span><a
      name="link185" id="link185"></a>the fire is put out by the fuel. In
      council, in debate, in society, he was all life and energy. His measures
      were strong, prompt, and daring, his oratory animated and glowing. His
      spirits were constantly high. No misfortune, public or private, could
      depress him. He was at once the most unlucky and the happiest public man
      of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been Secretary of State in Walpole&rsquo;s Administration, and had
      acquired considerable influence over the mind of George the First. The
      other ministers could speak no German. The King could speak no English.
      All the communication that Walpole held with his master was in very bad
      Latin. Carteret dismayed his colleagues by the volubility with which he
      addressed his Majesty in German. They listened with envy and terror to the
      mysterious gutturals which might possibly convey suggestions very little
      in unison with their wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walpole was not a man to endure such a colleague as Carteret. The King was
      induced to give up his favourite. Carteret joined the Opposition, and
      signalised himself at the head of that party till, after the retirement of
      his old rival, he again became Secretary of State.
    </p>
    <p>
      During some months he was chief Minister, indeed sole Minister. He gained
      the confidence and regard of George the Second. He was at the same time in
      high favour with the Prince of Wales. As a debater in the House of Lords,
      he had no equal among his colleagues. Among his opponents, Chesterfield
      alone could be considered as his match. Confident in his talents, and in
      the royal favour, he neglected all those means by which the power of
      Walpole had been created and maintained. His head was full of treaties
      <span class="pagenum">186</span><a name="link186" id="link186"></a>and
      expeditions, of schemes for supporting the Queen of Hungary and for
      humbling the House of Bourbon. He contemptuously abandoned to others all
      the drudgery, and, with the drudgery, all the fruits of corruption. The
      patronage of the Church and of the Bar he left to the Pelhams as a trifle
      unworthy of his care. One of the judges, Chief Justice Willes, if we
      remember rightly, went to him to beg some ecclesiastical preferment for a
      friend. Carteret said, that he was too much occupied with continental
      politics to think about the disposal of places and benefices. &ldquo;You may
      rely on it, then,&rdquo; said the Chief Justice, &ldquo;that people who want places
      and benefices will go to those who have more leisure.&rdquo; The prediction was
      accomplished. It would have been a busy time indeed in which the Pelhams
      had wanted leisure for jobbing; and to the Pelhams the whole cry of
      place-hunters and pension-hunters resorted. The parliamentary influence of
      the two brothers became stronger every day, till at length they were at
      the head of a decided majority in the House of Commons. Their rival,
      meanwhile, conscious of his powers, sanguine in his hopes, and proud of
      the storm which he had conjured up on the Continent, would brook neither
      superior nor equal. &ldquo;His rants,&rdquo; says Horace Walpole, &ldquo;are amazing; so are
      his parts and his spirits.&rdquo; He encountered the opposition of his
      colleagues, not with the fierce haughtiness of the first Pitt, or the cold
      unbending arrogance of the second, but with a gay vehemence, a
      good-humoured imperiousness, that bore every thing down before it. The
      period of his ascendency was known by the name of the &ldquo;Drunken
      Administration;&rdquo; and the expression was not altogether figurative. His
      habits were extremely convivial; and champagne probably lent its aid to
      keep <span class="pagenum">187</span><a name="link187" id="link187"></a>him
      in that state of joyous excitement in which his life was passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a rash and impetuous man of genius like Carteret should not have been
      able to maintain his ground in Parliament against the crafty and selfish
      Pelhams is not strange. But it is less easy to understand why he should
      have been generally unpopular throughout the country. His brilliant
      talents, his bold and open temper, ought, it should seem, to have made him
      a favourite with the public. But the people had been bitterly
      disappointed; and he had to face the first burst of their rage. His close
      connection with Pulteney, now the most detested man in the nation, was an
      unfortunate circumstance. He had, indeed, only three partisans, Pulteney,
      the King, and the Prince of Wales, a most singular assemblage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was driven from his office. He shortly after made a bold, indeed a
      desperate, attempt to recover power. The attempt failed. From that time he
      relinquished all ambitious hopes, and retired laughing to his books and
      his bottle. No statesman ever enjoyed success with so exquisite a relish,
      or submitted to defeat with so genuine and unforced a cheerfulness. Ill as
      he had been used, he did not seem, says Horace Walpole, to have any
      resentment, or indeed any feeling except thirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      These letters contain many good stories, some of them, no doubt, grossly
      exaggerated, about Lord Carteret; how, in the height of his greatness, he
      fell in love at first sight on a birthday with Lady Sophia Fermor, the
      handsome daughter of Lord Pomfret; how he plagued the Cabinet every day
      with reading to them her ladyship&rsquo;s letters; how strangely he brought home
      his bride; what fine jewels he gave her; how <span class="pagenum">188</span><a
      name="link188" id="link188"></a>he fondled her at Ranelagh; and what
      queen-like state she kept in Arlington Street. Horace Walpole has spoken
      less bitterly of Carteret than of any public man of that time, Fox perhaps
      excepted; and this is the more remarkable, because Carteret was one of the
      most inveterate enemies of Sir Robert. In the Memoirs, Horace Walpole,
      after passing in review all the great men whom England had produced within
      his memory, concludes by saying, that in genius none of them equalled Lord
      Granville. Smollett, in Humphrey Clinker, pronounces a similar judgment in
      coarser language. &ldquo;Since Granville was turned out, there has been no
      minister in this nation worth the meal that whitened his periwig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carteret fell: and the reign of the Pelhams commenced. It was Carteret&rsquo;s
      misfortune to be raised to power when the public mind was still smarting
      from recent disappointment. The nation had been duped, and was eager for
      revenge. A victim was necessary, and on such occasions the victims of
      popular rage are selected like the victim of Jephthah. The first person
      who comes in the way is made the sacrifice. The wrath of the people had
      now spent itself; and the unnatural excitement was succeeded by an
      unnatural calm. To an irrational eagerness for something new, succeeded an
      equally irrational disposition to acquiesce in every thing established. A
      few months back the people had been disposed to impute every crime to men
      in power, and to lend a ready ear to the high professions of men in
      opposition. They were now disposed to surrender themselves implicitly to
      the management of Ministers, and to look with suspicion and contempt on
      all who pretended to public spirit. The name of patriot had become a
      by-word of derision. Horace Walpole scarcely <span class="pagenum">189</span><a
      name="link189" id="link189"></a>exaggerated when he said that, in those
      times, the most popular declaration which a candidate could make on the
      hustings was that he had never been and never would be a patriot. At this
      conjuncture took place the rebellion of the Highland clans. The alarm
      produced by that event quieted the strife of internal factions. The
      suppression of the insurrection crushed for ever the spirit of the
      Jacobite party. Room was made in the Government for a few Tories. Peace
      was patched up with France and Spain. Death removed the Prince of Wales,
      who had contrived to keep together a small portion of that formidable
      opposition of which he had been the leader in the time of Sir Robert
      Walpole. Almost every man of weight in the House of Commons was officially
      connected with the Government. The even tenor of the session of Parliament
      was ruffled only by an occasional harangue from Lord Egmont on the army
      estimates. For the first time since the accession of the Stuarts there was
      no opposition. This singular good fortune, denied to the ablest statesmen,
      to Salisbury, to Strafford, to Clarendon, to Somers, to Walpole, had been
      reserved for the Pelhams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Pelham, it is true, was by no means a contemptible person. His
      understanding was that of Walpole on a somewhat smaller scale. Though not
      a brilliant orator, he was, like his master, a good debater, a good
      parliamentary tactician, a good man of business. Like his master he
      distinguished himself by the neatness and clearness of his financial
      expositions. Here the resemblance ceased. Their characters were altogether
      dissimilar. Walpole was good-humoured, but would have his way: his spirits
      were high, and his manners frank even to coarseness. The temper of Pelham
      was yielding, but peevish: his habits were regular, and his <span
      class="pagenum">190</span><a name="link190" id="link190"></a>deportment
      strictly decorous. Walpole was constitutionally fearless, Pelham
      constitutionally timid. Walpole had to face a strong opposition; but no
      man in the Government durst wag a finger against him. Almost all the
      opposition which Pelham had to encounter was from members of the
      Government of which he was the head. His own paymaster spoke against his
      estimates. His own secretary-at-war spoke against his Regency Bill. In one
      day Walpole turned Lord Chesterfield, Lord Burlington, and Lord Clinton
      out of the royal household, dismissed the highest dignitaries of Scotland
      from their posts, and took away the regiments of the Duke of Bolton and
      Lord Cobham, because he suspected them of having encouraged the resistance
      to his Excise Bill. He would far rather have contended with the strongest
      minority, under the ablest leaders, than have tolerated mutiny in his own
      party. It would have gone hard with any of his colleagues, who had
      ventured, on a Government question, to divide the House of Commons against
      him. Pelham, on the other hand, was disposed to bear any thing rather than
      drive from office any man round whom a new opposition could form. He
      therefore endured with fretful patience the insubordination of Pitt and
      Fox. He thought it far better to connive at their occasional infractions
      of discipline than to hear them, night after night, thundering against
      corruption and wicked ministers from the other side of the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      We wonder that Sir Walter Scott never tried his hand on the Duke of
      Newcastle. An interview between his Grace and Jeanie Deans would have been
      delightful, and by no means unnatural. There is scarcely any public man in
      our history of whose manners and conversation so many particulars have
      been <span class="pagenum">191</span><a name="link191" id="link191"></a>preserved.
      Single stories may be unfounded or exaggerated. But all the stories about
      him, whether told by people who were perpetually seeing him in Parliament
      and attending his levee in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, or by Grub Street writers
      who never had more than a glimpse of his star through the windows of his
      gilded coach, are of the same character. Horace Walpole and Smollett
      differed in their tastes and opinions as much as two human beings could
      differ. They kept quite different society. Walpole played at cards with
      countesses, and corresponded with ambassadors. Smollett passed his life
      surrounded by printer&rsquo;s devils and famished scribblers. Yet Walpole&rsquo;s Duke
      and Smollett&rsquo;s Duke are as like as if they were both from one hand.
      Smollett&rsquo;s Newcastle runs out of his dressing-room, with his face covered
      with soap-suds, to embrace the Moorish envoy. Walpole&rsquo;s Newcastle pushes
      his way into the Duke of Grafton&rsquo;s sick room to kiss the old nobleman&rsquo;s
      plasters. No man was so unmercifully satirised. But in truth he was
      himself a satire ready made. All that the art of the satirist does for
      other men, nature had done for him. Whatever was absurd about him stood
      out with grotesque prominence from the rest of the character. He was a
      living, moving, talking, caricature. His gait was a shuffling trot; his
      utterance a rapid stutter; he was always in a hurry; he was never in time;
      he abounded in fulsome caresses and in hysterical tears. His oratory
      resembled that of Justice Shallow. It was nonsense effervescent with
      animal spirits and impertinence. Of his ignorance many anecdotes remain,
      some well authenticated, some probably invented at coffee-houses, but all
      exquisitely characteristic. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;yes&mdash;to be sure&mdash;Annapolis
      must be defended&mdash;troops must be <span class="pagenum">192</span><a
      name="link192" id="link192"></a>sent to Annapolis&mdash;Pray where is
      Annapolis?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Cape Breton an island! wonderful!&mdash;show it me in
      the map. So it is, sure enough. My dear sir, you always bring us good
      news. I must go and tell the King that Cape Breton is an island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this man was, during near thirty years, Secretary of State, and,
      during near ten years, First Lord of the Treasury! His large fortune, his
      strong hereditary connection, his great parliamentary interest, will not
      alone explain this extraordinary fact. His success is a signal instance of
      what may be effected by a man who devotes his whole heart and soul without
      reserve to one object. He was eaten up by ambition. His love of influence
      and authority resembled the avarice of the old usurer in the Fortunes of
      Nigel. It was so intense a passion that it supplied the place of talents,
      that it inspired even fatuity with cunning. &ldquo;Have no money dealings with
      my father,&rdquo; says Martha to Lord Glenvarloch; &ldquo;for, dotard as he is, he
      will make an ass of you.&rdquo; It was as dangerous to have any political
      connection with Newcastle as to buy and sell with old Trapbois. He was
      greedy after power with a greediness all his own. He was jealous of all
      his colleagues, and even of his own brother. Under the disguise of levity
      he was false beyond all example of political falsehood. All the able men
      of his time ridiculed him as a dunce, a driveller, a child who never knew
      his own mind for an hour together; and he overreached them all round.

      If the country had remained at peace, it is not impossible that this man
      would have continued at the head of affairs without admitting any other
      person to a share of his authority until the throne was filled by a new
      Prince, who brought with him new maxims of <span class="pagenum">193</span><a
      name="link193" id="link193"></a>government, new favourites, and a strong
      will. But the inauspicious commencement of the Seven Years&rsquo; War brought on
      a crisis to which Newcastle was altogether unequal. After a calm of
      fifteen years the spirit of the nation was again stirred to its inmost
      depths. In a few days the whole aspect of the political world was changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that change is too remarkable an event to be discussed at the end of
      an article already more than sufficiently long. It is probable that we
      may, at no remote time, resume the subject.

      have elapsed since the publication of this work, it is still, we believe,
      a new publication to most of our readers, is or are we surprised at this.
      The book is large, and the style heavy. The information which Mr.
      Thackeray has obtained from the State Paper Office is new; but much of it
      is very uninteresting. The rest of his narrative is very little better
      than Gifford&rsquo;s or Tomline&rsquo;s Life of the second Pitt, and tells us little
      or nothing that may not be found quite as well told in the Parliamentary
      History, the Annual Register, and other works equally common.

      Almost every mechanical employment, it is said, has a tendency to injure
      some one or other of the bodily organs of the artisan. Grinders of cutlery
      die of consumption; weavers are stunted in then&rsquo; growth; smiths become
      blear-eyed. In the same manner almost every intellectual employment has a

      lives or the writings of others, are peculiarly exposed to the <i>Lues
      Boswelliana</i>, or disease of admiration. But we scarcely remember ever
      to have seen a patient so far gone in this distemper as Mr. Thackeray. He
      is not satisfied with forcing us to confess that Pitt was a great orator,
      a vigorous minister, an honourable and high-spirited gentleman. He will
      have it that all virtues and all accomplishments met in his hero. In spite
      of Gods, men, and columns, Pitt must be a poet, a poet capable of
      producing a heroic poem of the first order; and we are assured that we
      ought to find many charms in such lines as these: <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">"Midst all the tumults of the warring sphere, <br /><span
      class="indent20">My light-charged bark may haply glide; <br /><span
      class="indent20">Some gale may waft, some conscious thought shall cheer,
      <br /><span class="indent20">And the small freight unanxious glide.&rdquo; (1)
      </span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt was in the army for a few months in time of peace. Mr. Thackeray
      accordingly insists on our confessing that, if the young cornet had
      remained in the service he would have been one of the ablest commanders
      that ever lived. But this is not all. Pitt, it seems, was not merely a
      great poet <i>in esse</i>, and a great general <i>in posse</i>, but a
      finished example of moral excellence, the just man made perfect. He was in
      the right when he attempted to establish an inquisition, and to give
      bounties for perjury, in order to get Walpole&rsquo;s head. He was in the right
      when he declared Walpole to have been an excellent minister. He was in the
      right when, being in opposition, he maintained that no peace ought to be
      made with Spain, till she should formally renounce the right of search.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) The quotation is faithfully made from Mr. Thackeray.
     Perhaps Pitt wrote guide in the fourth line.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">196</span><a name="link196" id="link196"></a>He was
      in the right when, being in office, he silently acquiesced in a treaty by
      which Spain did not renounce the right of search. When he left the Duke of
      Newcastle, when he coalesced with the Duke of Newcastle, when he thundered
      against subsidies, when he lavished subsidies with unexampled profusion,
      when he execrated the Hanoverian connection, when he declared that Hanover
      ought to be as dear to us as Hampshire, he was still invariably speaking
      the language of a virtuous and enlightened statesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is that there scarcely ever lived a person who had so little
      claim to this sort of praise as Pitt. He was undoubtedly a great man. But
      his was not a complete and well-proportioned greatness. The public life of
      Hampden or of Somers resembles a regular drama, which can be criticised as
      a whole, and every scene of which is to be viewed in connection with the
      main action. The public life of Pitt, on the other hand, is a rude though
      striking piece, a piece abounding in incongruities, a piece without any
      unity of plan, but redeemed by some noble passages, the effect of which is
      increased by the tameness or extravagance of what precedes and of what
      follows. His opinions were un-fixed. His conduct at some of the most
      important conjunctures of his life was evidently determined by pride and
      resentment. He had one fault, which of all human faults is most rarely
      found in company with true greatness. He was extremely affected. He was an
      almost solitary instance of a man of real genius, and of a brave, lofty,
      and commanding spirit, without simplicity of character. He was an actor in
      the Closet, an actor at Council, an actor in Parliament; and even in
      private society he could not lay aside his theatrical tones and attitudes.
      We know that one of the most <span class="pagenum">197</span><a
      name="link197" id="link197"></a>distinguished of his partisans often
      complained that he could never obtain admittance to Lord Chatham&rsquo;s room
      till every thing was ready for the representation, till the dresses and
      properties were all correctly disposed, till the light was thrown with
      Rembrandt-like effect on the head of the illustrious performer, till the
      flannels had been arranged with the air of a Grecian drapery, and the
      crutch placed as gracefully as that of Belisarius or Lear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, with all his faults and affectations, Pitt had, in a very
      extraordinary degree, many of the elements of greatness. He had genius,
      strong passions, quick sensibility, and vehement enthusiasm for the grand
      and the beautiful. There was something about him which ennobled
      tergiversation itself. He often went wrong, very wrong. But, to quote the
      language of Wordsworth, <br /><br /><span class="indent30">"He still
      retained, <br /><span class="indent15">&rdquo; &rsquo;Mid such abasement, what he had
      received <br /><span class="indent15">From nature, an intense and glowing
      mind.&rdquo; </span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In an age of low and dirty prostitution, in the age of Dodington and
      Sandys, it was something to have a man who might perhaps, under some
      strong excitement, have been tempted to ruin his country, but who never
      would have stooped to pilfer from her, a man whose errors arose, not from
      a sordid desire of gain, but from a fierce thirst for power, for glory,
      and for vengeance. History owes to him this attestation, that, at a time
      when any thing short of direct embezzlement of the public money was
      considered as quite fair in public men, he showed the most scrupulous
      disinterestedness; that, at a time when it seemed to be generally taken
      for granted that Government could be upheld only by the basest and most
      immoral arts, he appealed to the better <span class="pagenum">198</span><a
      name="link198" id="link198"></a>and nobler parts of human nature; that he
      made a brave and splendid attempt to do, by means of public opinion, what
      no other statesman of his day thought it possible to do, except by means
      of corruption; that he looked for support, not, like the Pelhams, to a
      strong aristocratical connection, not like Bute, to the personal favour of
      the sovereign, but to the middle class of Englishmen; that he inspired
      that class with a firm confidence in his integrity and ability; that,
      backed by them, he forced an unwilling court and an unwilling oligarchy to
      admit him to an ample share of power; and that he used his power in such a
      manner as clearly proved him to have sought it, not for the sake of profit
      or patronage, but from a wish to establish for himself a great and durable
      reputation by means of eminent services rendered to the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family of Pitt was wealthy and respectable. His grandfather was
      Governor of Madras, and brought back from India that celebrated diamond,
      which the Regent Orleans, by the advice of Saint Simon, purchased for
      upwards of two millions of livres, and which is still considered as the
      most precious of the crown jewels of France. Governor Pitt bought estates
      and rotten boroughs, and sat in the House of Commons for Old Sarum. His
      son Robert was at one time member for Old Sarum, and at another for
      Oakhampton. Robert had two sons. Thomas, the elder, inherited the estates
      and the parliamentary interest of his father. The second was the
      celebrated William Pitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was born in November, 1708. About the early part of his life little
      more is known than that he was educated at Eton, and that at seventeen he
      was entered at Trinity College, Oxford. During the second year of his
      residence at the University, George the <span class="pagenum">199</span><a
      name="link199" id="link199"></a>First died; and the event was, after the
      fashion of that generation, celebrated by the Oxonians in many middling
      copies of verses. On this occasion Pitt published some Latin lines, which
      Mr. Thackeray has preserved. They prove that the young student had but a
      very limited knowledge even of the mechanical part of his art. All true
      Etonians will hear with concern that their illustrious schoolfellow is
      guilty of making the first syllable in <i>labenti</i> short. (1) The
      matter of the poem is as worthless as that of any college exercise that
      was ever written before or since. There is, of course, much about Mars,
      Themis, Neptune, and Cocytus. The muses are earnestly entreated to weep
      over the urn of Cæsar; for Cæsar, says the Poet, loved the Muses; Cæsar,
      who could not read a line of Pope, and who loved nothing but punch and fat
      women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt had been, from his school-days, cruelly tormented by the gout, and
      was advised to travel for his health. He accordingly left Oxford without
      taking a degree, and visited France and Italy. He returned, however,
      without having received much benefit from his excursion, and continued,
      till the close of his life, to suffer most severely from his
      constitutional malady.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father was now dead, and had left very little to the younger children.
      It was necessary that William should choose a profession. He decided for
      the army, and a cornet&rsquo;s commission was procured for him in the Blues.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, small as his fortune was, his family had both the power and the
      inclination to serve him. At the general election of 1784, his elder
      brother Thomas was
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) So Mr. Thackeray has printed the poem. But it may be
     charitably hoped that Pitt wrote labenti.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">200</span><a name="link200" id="link200"></a>chosen
      both for Old Sarum and for Oakhampton. When Parliament met in 1735, Thomas
      made his election to serve for Oakhampton, and William was returned for
      Old Sarum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walpole had now been, during fourteen years, at the head of affairs. He
      had risen to power under the most favorable circumstances. The whole of
      the Whig party, of that party which professed peculiar attachment to the
      principles of the Revolution, and which exclusively enjoyed the confidence
      of the reigning house, had been united in support of his administration.
      Happily for him, he had been out of office when the South-Sea Act was
      passed; and though he does not appear to have foreseen all the
      consequences of that measure, he had strenuously opposed it, as he had
      opposed all the measures, good and bad, of Sunderland&rsquo;s administration.
      When the South-Sea Company were voting dividends of fifty per cent., when
      a hundred pounds of their stock were selling for eleven hundred pounds,
      when Threadneedle Street was daily crowded with the coaches of dukes and
      prelates, when divines and philosophers turned gamblers, when a thousand
      kindred bubbles were daily blown into existence, the periwig-company, and
      the Spanish-jackass-company, and the quicksilver-fixation-company,
      Walpole&rsquo;s calm good sense preserved him from the general infatuation. He
      condemned the prevailing madness in public, and turned a considerable sum
      by taking advantage of it in private. When the crash came, when ten
      thousand families were reduced to beggary in a day, when the people, in
      the frenzy of their rage and despair, clamoured, not only against the
      lower agents in the juggle, but against the Hanoverian favourites, against
      the English ministers, against the King himself, when Parliament met,
      <span class="pagenum">201</span><a name="link201" id="link201"></a>eager
      for confiscation and blood, when members of the House of Commons proposed
      that the directors should be treated like parricides in ancient Rome, tied
      up in sacks, and thrown into the Thames, Walpole was the man on whom all
      parties turned their eyes. Four years before he had been driven from power
      by the intrigues of Sunderland and Stanhope; and the lead in the House of
      Commons had been intrusted to Craggs and Aislabie. Stanhope was no more.
      Aislabie was expelled from Parliament on account of his disgraceful
      conduct regarding the South-Sea scheme. Craggs was perhaps saved by a
      timely death from a similar mark of infamy. A large minority in the House
      of Commons voted for a severe censure on Sunderland, who, finding it
      impossible to withstand the force of the prevailing sentiment, retired
      from office, and outlived his retirement but a very short time. The schism
      which had divided the Whig party was now completely healed. Walpole had no
      opposition to encounter except that of the Tories; and the Tories were
      naturally regarded by the King with the strongest suspicion and dislike.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time business went on with a smoothness and a despatch such as had
      not been known since the days of the Tudors. During the session of 1724,
      for example, there was hardly a single division except on private bills.
      It is not impossible that, by taking the course which Pelham afterwards
      took, by admitting into the government all the rising talents and ambition
      of the Whig party, and by making room here and there for a Tory not
      unfriendly to the House of Brunswick, Walpole might have averted the
      tremendous conflict in which he passed the later years of his
      administration, and in which he was at length vanquished. The Opposition
      which overthrew him was an Opposition <span class="pagenum">202</span><a
      name="link202" id="link202"></a>created by his own policy, by his own
      insatiable love of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the very act of forming his Ministry he turned one of the ablest and
      most attached of his supporters into a deadly enemy. Pulteney had strong
      public and private claims to a high situation in the new arrangement. His
      fortune was immense. His private character was respectable. He was already
      a distinguished speaker. He had acquired official experience in an
      important post. He had been, through all changes of fortune, a consistent
      Whig. When the Whig party was split into two sections, Pulteney had
      resigned a valuable place, and had followed the fortunes of Walpole. Yet,
      when Walpole returned to power, Pulteney was not invited to take office.
      An angry discussion took place between the friends. The Ministry offered a
      peerage. It was impossible for Pulteney not to discern the motive of such
      an offer. He indignantly refused to accept it. For some time he continued
      to brood over his wrongs, and to watch for an opportunity of revenge. As
      soon as a favourable conjuncture arrived he joined the minority, and
      became the greatest leader of Opposition that the House of Commons had
      ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the members of the Cabinet, Carteret was the most eloquent and
      accomplished. His talents for debate were of the first order; his
      knowledge of foreign affairs was superior to that of any living statesman;
      his attachment to the Protestant succession was undoubted. But there was
      not room in one Government for him and Walpole. Carteret retired, and was,
      from that time forward, one of the most persevering and formidable enemies
      of his old colleague.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was any man with whom Walpole could <span class="pagenum">203</span><a
      name="link203" id="link203"></a>have consented to make a partition of
      power, that man was Lord Townshend. They were distant kinsmen by birth,
      near kinsmen by marriage. They had been friends from childhood. They had
      been schoolfellows at Eton. They were country neighbors in Norfolk. They
      had been in office together under Godolphin. They had gone into opposition
      together when Harley rose to power. They had been persecuted by the same
      House of Commons. They had, after the death of Anne, been recalled
      together to office. They had again been driven out together by Sunderland,
      and had again come back together when the influence of Sunderland had
      declined. Their opinions on public affairs almost always coincided. They
      were both men of frank, generous, and compassionate natures. Their
      intercourse had been for many years affectionate and cordial. But the ties
      of blood, of marriage, and of friendship, the memory of mutual services,
      the memory of common triumphs and common disasters, were insufficient to
      restrain that ambition which domineered over all the virtues and vices of
      Walpole. He was resolved, to use his own metaphor, that the firm of the
      house should be, not Townshend and Walpole, but Walpole and Townshend. At
      length the rivals proceeded to personal abuse before a large company,
      seized each other by the collar, and grasped their swords. The women
      squalled. The men parted the combatants. By friendly intervention the
      scandal of a duel between cousins, brothers-in-law, old friends, and old
      colleagues, was prevented. But the disputants could not long continue to
      act together. Townshend retired, and, with rare moderation and public
      spirit, refused to take any part in politics. He could not, he said, trust
      his temper. He feared that the recollection of his private wrongs might
      impel him <span class="pagenum">204</span><a name="link204" id="link204"></a>to
      follow the example of Pulteney, and to oppose measures which he thought
      generally beneficial to the country. He therefore never visited London
      after his resignation, but passed the closing years of his life in dignity
      and repose among his trees and pictures at Rainham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next went Chesterfield. He too was a Whig; and a friend of the Protestant
      succession. He was an orator, a courtier, a wit, and a man of letters. He
      was at the head of ton in days when, in order to be at the head of ton, it
      was not sufficient to be dull and supercilious. It was evident that he
      submitted impatiently to the ascendency of Walpole. He murmured against
      the Excise Bill. His brothers voted against it in the House of Commons.
      The Minister acted with characteristic caution and characteristic energy;
      caution in the conduct of public affairs; energy where his own supremacy
      was concerned. He withdrew his Bill, and turned out all his hostile or
      wavering colleagues. Chesterfield was stopped on the great staircase of
      St. James&rsquo;s and summoned to deliver up the staff which he bore as Lord
      Steward of the Household. A crowd of noble and powerful functionaries, the
      Dukes of Montrose and Bolton, Lord Burlington, Lord Stair, Lord Cobham,
      Lord Marchmont, Lord Clinton, were at the same time dismissed from the
      service of the Crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after these events the Opposition was reinforced by the Duke of
      Argyle, a man vainglorious indeed and fickle, but brave, eloquent, and
      popular. It was in a great measure owing to his exertions that the Act of
      Settlement had been peaceably carried into effect in England immediately
      after the death of Anne, and that the Jacobite rebellion which, during the
      following year, broke out in Scotland, had been suppressed. He too carried
      over to the minority the aid of his great <span class="pagenum">205</span><a
      name="link205" id="link205"></a>name, his talents, and his paramount
      influence in his native country.
    </p>
    <p>
      In each of these cases taken separately, a skilful defender of Walpole
      might perhaps make out a case for him. But when we see that during a long
      course of years all the footsteps are turned the same way, that all the
      most eminent of those public men who agreed with the Minister in their
      general views of policy left him, one after another, with sore and
      irritated minds, we find it impossible not to believe that the real
      explanation of the phænomenon is to be found in the words of his son, &ldquo;Sir
      Robert Walpole loved power so much that he would not endure a rival.&rdquo; Hume
      has described this famous minister with great felicity in one short
      sentence,&mdash;&ldquo;moderate in exercising power, not equitable in engrossing
      it.&rdquo; Kind-hearted, jovial, and placable as Walpole was, he was yet a man
      with whom no person of high pretensions and high spirit could long
      continue to act. He had, therefore, to stand against an Opposition
      containing all the most accomplished statesmen of the age, with no better
      support than that which he received from persons like his brother Horace
      or Henry Pelham, whose industrious mediocrity gave no cause for jealousy,
      or from clever adventurers, whose situation and character diminished the
      dread which their talents might have inspired. To this last class belonged
      Fox, who was too poor to live without office; Sir William Yonge, of whom
      Walpole himself said, that nothing but such parts could buoy up such a
      character, and that nothing but such a character could drag down such
      parts; and Winnington, whose private morals lay, justly or unjustly, under
      imputations of the worst kind.

      The discontented Whigs were, not perhaps in number, <span class="pagenum">206</span><a
      name="link206" id="link206"></a>but certainly in ability, experience, and
      weight, by far the most important part of the Opposition. The Tories
      furnished little more than rows of ponderous fox hunters, fat with
      Staffordshire or Devonshire ale, men who drank to the King over the water,
      and believed that all the fundholders were Jews, men whose religion
      consisted in hating the Dissenters, and whose political researches had led
      them to fear, like Squire Western, that their land might be sent over to
      Hanover to be put in the sinking-fund. The eloquence of these zealous
      squires, the remnant of the once formidable October Club, seldom went
      beyond a hearty Aye or No. Very few members of this party had
      distinguished themselves much in Parliament, or could, under any
      circumstances, have been called to fill any high office; and those few had
      generally, like Sir William Wyndham, learned in the company of their new
      associates the doctrines of toleration and political liberty, and might
      indeed with strict propriety be called Whigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to the Whigs in Opposition, the Patriots, as they were called, that
      the most distinguished of the English youth who at this season entered
      into public life attached themselves. These inexperienced politicians felt
      all the enthusiasm which the name of liberty naturally excites in young
      and ardent minds. They conceived that the theory of the Tory Opposition
      and the practice of Walpole&rsquo;s Government were alike inconsistent with the
      principles of liberty. They accordingly repaired to the standard which
      Pulteney had set up. While opposing the Whig minister, they professed a
      firm adherence to the purest doctrines of Whiggism. He was the schismatic;
      they were the true Catholics, the peculiar people, the depositaries <span
      class="pagenum">207</span><a name="link207" id="link207"></a>of the
      orthodox faith of Hampden and Russell, the one sect which, amidst the
      corruptions generated by time and by the long possession of power, had
      preserved inviolate the principles of the Revolution. Of the young men who
      attached themselves to this portion of the Opposition the most
      distinguished were Lyttelton and Pitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pitt entered Parliament, the whole political world was attentively
      watching the progress of an event which soon added great strength to the
      Opposition, and particularly to that section of the Opposition in which
      the young statesman enrolled himself. The Prince of Wales was gradually
      becoming more and more estranged from his father and his father&rsquo;s
      ministers, and more and more friendly to the Patriots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is more natural than that, in a monarchy where a constitutional
      Opposition exists, the heir-apparent of the throne should put himself at
      the head of that Opposition. He is impelled to such a course by every
      feeling of ambition and of vanity. He cannot be more than second in the
      estimation of the party which is in. He is sure to be the first member of
      the party which is out. The highest favour which the existing
      administration can expect from him is that he will not discard them. But,
      if he joins the Opposition, all his associates expect that he will promote
      them; and the feelings which men entertain towards one from whom they hope
      to obtain great advantages which they have not are far warmer than the
      feelings with which they regard one who, at the very utmost, can only
      leave them in possession of what they already have. An heir-apparent,
      therefore, who wishes to enjoy, in the highest perfection, all the
      pleasure that can be derived from eloquent flattery and profound respect,
      will always join those <span class="pagenum">208</span><a name="link208"
       id="link208"></a>who are struggling to force themselves into power. This
      is, we believe, the true explanation of a fact which Lord Granville
      attributed to some natural peculiarity in the illustrious House of
      Brunswick. &ldquo;This family,&rdquo; said he at Council, we suppose after his daily
      halt-gallon of Burgundy, &ldquo;always has quarrelled, and always will quarrel,
      from generation to generation.&rdquo; He should have known something of the
      matter; for he had been a favourite with three successive generations of
      the royal house. We cannot quite admit his explanation; but the fact is
      indisputable. Since the accession of George the First, there have been
      four Princes of Wales, and they have all been almost constantly in
      Opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever might have been the motives which induced Prince Frederic to join
      the party opposed to the government, his support infused into many members
      of that party a courage and an energy of which they stood greatly in need.
      Hitherto it had been impossible for the discontented Whig! not to feel
      some misgivings when they found themselves dividing, night after night,
      with uncompromising Jacobites who were known to be in constant
      communication with the exiled family, or with Tories who had impeached
      Somers, who had murmured against Harley and St. John as too remiss in the
      cause of the Church and the landed interest, and who, if they were not
      inclined to attack the reigning family, yet considered the introduction of
      that family as, at best, only the less of two great evils, as a necessary
      but painful and humiliating preservative against Popery. The Minister
      might plausibly say that Pulteney and Carteret, in the hope of gratifying
      their own appetite for office and for revenge, did not scruple to serve
      the purposes of a faction hostile to the Protestant <span class="pagenum">209</span><a
      name="link209" id="link209"></a>succession. The appearance of Frederic at
      the head of the patriots silenced this reproach. The leaders of the
      Opposition might now boast that their course was sanctioned by a person as
      deeply interested as the King himself in maintaining the Act of
      Settlement, and that, instead of serving the purposes of the Tory party,
      they had brought that party over to the side of Whiggism. It must indeed
      be admitted that, though both the King and the Prince behaved in a manner
      little to their honour, though the father acted harshly, the son
      disrespectfully, and both &lsquo;childishly, the royal family was rather
      strengthened than weakened by the disagreement of its two most
      distinguished members. A large class of politicians, who had considered
      themselves as placed under sentence of perpetual exclusion from office,
      and who, in their despair, had been almost ready to join in a
      counter-revolution as the only mode of removing the proscription under
      which they lay, now saw with pleasure an easier and safer road to power
      opening before them, and thought it far better to wait till, in the
      natural course of things, the Crown should descend to the heir of the
      House of Brunswick, than to risk their lands and their necks in a rising
      for the House of Stuart. The situation of the royal family resembled the
      situation of those Scotch families in which father and son took opposite
      sides during the rebellion, in order that, come what might, the estate
      might not be forfeited.
    </p>
    <p>
      In April, 1786, Frederic was married to the Princess of Saxe Gotha, with
      whom he afterwards lived on terms very similar to those on which his
      father had lived with Queen Caroline. The Prince adored his wife, and
      thought her in mind and person the most attractive of her sex. But he
      thought that conjugal fidelity <span class="pagenum">210</span><a
      name="link210" id="link210"></a>was an unprincely virtue; and, in order to
      be like Henry the Fourth, and the Regent Orleans, he affected a
      libertinism for which he had no taste, and frequently quitted the only
      woman whom he loved for ugly and disagreeable mistresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The address which the House of Commons presented to the King on the
      occasion of the Prince&rsquo;s marriage was moved, not by the Minister, but by
      Pulteney, the leader of the Whigs in Opposition. It was on this motion
      that Pitt, who had not broken silence during the session in which he took
      his seat, addressed the House for the first time. &ldquo;A contemporary
      historian,&rdquo; says Mr. Thackeray, &ldquo;describes Mr. Pitt&rsquo;s first speech as
      superior even to the models of ancient eloquence. According to Tindal, it
      was more ornamented than the speeches of Demosthenes, and less diffuse
      than those of Cicero.&rdquo; This unmeaning phrase has been a hundred times
      quoted. That it should ever have been quoted, except to be laughed at, is
      strange. The vogue which it has obtained may serve to show in how slovenly
      a way most people are content to think. Did Tindal, who first used it, or
      Archdeacon Coxe and Mr. Thackeray, who have borrowed it, ever in their
      lives hear any speaking which did not deserve the same compliment? Did
      they ever hear speaking less ornamented than that of Demosthenes, or more
      diffuse than that of Cicero? We know no living orator, from Lord Brougham
      down to Mr. Hunt, who is not entitled to the same eulogy. It would be no
      very flattering compliment to a man&rsquo;s figure to say, that he was taller
      than the Polish Count, and shorter than Giant O&rsquo;Brien, fatter than the <i>Anatomie
      Vivante</i>, and more slender than Daniel Lambert. <span class="pagenum">211</span><a
      name="link211" id="link211"></a>Pitt&rsquo;s speech, as it is reported in the
      Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine, certainly deserves Tindal&rsquo;s compliment, and deserves
      no other. It is just as empty and wordy as a maiden speech on such an
      occasion might be expected to be. But the fluency and the personal
      advantages of the young orator instantly caught the ear and eye of his
      audience. He was, from the day of his first appearance, always heard with
      attention; and exercise soon developed the great powers which he
      possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our time, the audience of a member of Parliament is the nation. The
      three or four hundred persons who may be present while a speech is
      delivered may be pleased or disgusted by the voice and action of the
      orator; but, in the reports which are read the next day by hundreds of
      thousands, the difference between the noblest and the meanest figure,
      between the richest and the shrillest tones, between the most graceful and
      the most uncouth gesture, altogether vanishes. A hundred years ago,
      scarcely any report of what passed within the walls of the House of
      Commons was suffered to get abroad. In those times, therefore, the
      impression which a speaker might make on the persons who actually heard
      him was every thing. His fame out of doors depended entirely on the report
      of those who were within the doors. In the Parliaments of that time,
      therefore, as in the ancient commonwealths, those qualifications which
      enhance the immediate effect of a speech, were far more important
      ingredients in the composition of an orator than at present. All those
      qualifications Pitt possessed in the highest degree. On the stage, he
      would have been the finest Brutus or Coriolanus ever seen. Those who saw
      him in his decay, when his health was broken, when his <span
      class="pagenum">212</span><a name="link212" id="link212"></a>mind was
      untuned, when he had been removed from that stormy assembly of which he
      thoroughly knew the temper, and over which he possessed unbounded
      influence, to a small, a torpid, and an unfriendly audience, say that his
      speaking was then, for the most part, a low, monotonous muttering, audible
      only to those who sat close to him, that when violently excited, he
      sometimes raised his voice for a few minutes, but that it soon sank again
      into an unintelligible murmur. Such was the Earl of Chatham; but such was
      not William Pitt. His figure, when he first appeared in Parliament, was
      strikingly graceful and commanding, his features high and noble, his eye
      full of fire. His voice, even when it sank to a whisper, was heard to the
      remotest benches; and when he strained it to its full extent, the sound
      rose like the swell of the organ of a great cathedral, shook the house
      with its peal, and was heard through lobbies and down staircases, to the
      Court of Requests and the precincts of Westminster Hall. He cultivated all
      these eminent advantages with the most assiduous care. His action is
      described by a very malignant observer as equal to that of Garrick. His
      play of countenance was wonderful: he frequently disconcerted a hostile
      orator by a single glance of indignation or scorn. Every tone, from the
      impassioned cry to the thrilling aside, was perfectly at his command. It
      is by no means improbable that the pains which he took to improve his
      great personal advantages had, in some respects, a prejudicial operation,
      and tended to nourish in him that passion for theatrical effect which, as
      we have already remarked, was one of the most conspicuous blemishes in his
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not solely or principally to outward accomplishments that Pitt
      owed the vast influence <span class="pagenum">213</span><a name="link213"
       id="link213"></a>which, during nearly thirty years, he exercised over the
      House of Commons. He was undoubtedly a great orator; and, from the
      descriptions given by his contemporaines, and the fragments of his
      speeches which still remain, it is not difficult to discover the nature
      and extent of his oratorical powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was no speaker of set speeches. His few prepared discourses were
      complete failures. The elaborate panegyric which he pronounced on General
      Wolfe was considered as the very worst of all his performances. &ldquo;No man,&rdquo;
       says a critic who had often heard him, &ldquo;ever knew so little what he was
      going to say.&rdquo; Indeed his facility amounted to a vice. He was not the
      master, but the slave of his own speech. So little selfcommand had he when
      once he felt the impulse, that he did not like to take part in a debate
      when his mind was full of an important secret of state. &ldquo;I must sit
      still,&rdquo; he once said to Lord Shelburne on such an occasion; &ldquo;for, when
      once I am up, every thing that is in my mind comes out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet he was not a great debater. That he should not have been so when first
      he entered the House of Commons is not strange. Scarcely any person has
      ever become so without long practice and many failures. It was by slow
      degrees, as Burke said, that Charles Fox became the most brilliant and
      powerful debater that ever lived. Charles Fox himself attributed his own
      success to the resolution which he formed when very young, of speaking,
      well or ill, at least once every night. &ldquo;During five whole sessions,&rdquo; he
      used to say, &ldquo;I spoke every night but one; and I regret only that I did
      not speak on that night too.&rdquo; Indeed, with the exception of Mr. Stanley,
      whose knowledge of the science of parliamentary defence resembles an <span
      class="pagenum">214</span><a name="link214" id="link214"></a>instinct, it
      would be difficult to name any eminent debater who had not made himself a
      master of his art at the expense of his audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as this art is one which even the ablest men have seldom acquired
      without long practice, so it is one which men of respectable abilities,
      with assiduous and intrepid practice, seldom fail to acquire. It is
      singular that, in such an art, Pitt, a man of great parts, of great
      fluency, of great boldness, a man whose whole life was passed in
      parlimentary conflict, a man who, during several years was the leading
      minister of the Crown in the House of Commons, should never have attained
      to high excellence. He spoke without premeditation; but his speech
      followed the course of his own thoughts, and not the coux*se of the
      previous discussion. He could, indeed, treasure up in his memory some
      detached expression of an opponent, and make it the text for lively
      ridicule or solemn reprehension. Some of the most celebrated bursts of his
      eloquence were called forth by an unguarded word, a laugh, or a cheer. But
      this was the only sort of reply in which he appears to have excelled. He
      was perhaps the only great English orator who did not think it any
      advantage to have the last word, and who generally spoke by choice before
      his most formidable antagonists. His merit was almost entirely rhetorical.
      He did not succeed either in exposition or in refutation; but his speeches
      abounded in lively illustrations, striking apophthegms, well told
      anecdotes, happy allusions, passionate appeals. His invective and sarcasm
      were terrific. Perhaps no English orator was ever so much feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that which gave most effect to his declamation was the air of
      sincerity, of vehement feeling, of moral <span class="pagenum">215</span><a
      name="link215" id="link215"></a>elevation, which belonged to all that he
      said. His style was not always in the purest taste. Several contemporary
      judges pronounced it too florid. Walpole, in the midst of the rapturous
      eulogy which he pronounces on one of Pitt&rsquo;s greatest orations, owns that
      some of the metaphors were too forced. Some of Pitt&rsquo;s quotations and
      classical stories are too trite for a clever schoolboy. But these were
      niceties for which the audience eared little. The enthusiasm of the orator
      infected all who heard him; his ardour and his noble bearing put fire into
      the most frigid conceit, and gave dignity to the most puerile allusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      His powers soon began to give annoyance to the Government; and Walpole
      determined to make an example of the patriotic cornet. Pitt was
      accordingly dismissed from the service. Mr. Thackeray says that the
      Minister took this step, because he plainly saw that it would have been
      vain to think of buying over so honourable and disinterested an opponent.
      We do not dispute Pitt&rsquo;s integrity; but we do not know what proof he had
      given of it when he was turned out of the army; and we are sure that
      Walpole was not likely to give credit for inflexible honesty to a young
      adventurer, who had never had an opportunity of refusing any thing. The
      truth is, that it was not Walpole&rsquo;s practice to buy off enemies. Mr. Burke
      truly says, in the Appeal to the Old Whigs, that Walpole gained very few
      over from the Opposition. Indeed that great minister knew his business far
      too well. He knew that, for one mouth which is stopped with a place, fifty
      other mouths will be instantly opened. He knew that it would have been
      very bad policy in him to give the world to understand that more was to be
      got by thwarting his measures than by supporting them. <span
      class="pagenum">216</span><a name="link216" id="link216"></a>Those maxims
      are as old as the origin of parliamentary corruption in England. Pepys
      learned them, as he tells us, from the counsellors of Charles the Second.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt was no loser. He was made Groom of the Bedchamber to the Prince of W
      ales, and continued to declaim against the ministers with unabated
      violence and with increasing ability. The question of maritime right, then
      agitated between Spain and England, called forth all his powers. He
      clamoured for war with a vehemence which it is not easy to reconcile with
      reason or humanity, but which appears to Mr. Thackeray worthy of the
      highest admiration. We will not stop to argue a point on which we had long
      thought that all well-informed people were agreed. We could easily show,
      we think, that if any respect be due to international law, if right, where
      societies of men are concerned, be any thing but another name for might,
      if we do not adopt the doctrine of the Buccaniers, which seems to be also
      the doctrine of Mr. Thackeray, that treaties mean nothing within thirty
      degrees of the line, the war with Spain was altogether unjustifiable. But
      the truth is, that the promoters of that war have saved the historian the
      trouble of trying them. They have pleaded guilty. &ldquo;I have seen,&rdquo; says
      Burke, &ldquo;and with some care examined, the original documents concerning
      certain important transactions of those times. They perfectly satisfied me
      of the extreme injustice of that war, and of the falsehood of the colours
      which Walpole, to his ruin, and guided by a mistaken policy, suffered to
      be daubed over that measure. Some years after, it was my fortune to
      converse with many of the principal actors against that minister, and with
      those who principally excited that clamour. None of them, no not one, did
      in the least defend the measure, or <span class="pagenum">217</span><a
      name="link217" id="link217"></a>attempt to justify their conduct. They
      condemned it as freely as they would have done in commenting upon any
      proceeding in history in which they were totally unconcerned.&rdquo; Pitt, on
      subsequent occasions, gave ample proof that he was one of these penitents.
      But his conduct, even where it appeared most criminal to himself, appears
      admirable to his biographer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elections of 1741 were unfavourable to Walpole; and after a long and
      obstinate struggle he found it necessary to resign. The Duke of Newcastle
      and Lord Hardwicke opened a negotiation with the leading patriots, in the
      hope of forming an administration on a Whig basis. At this conjuncture,
      Pitt and those persons who were most nearly connected with him acted in a
      manner very little to their honour. They attempted to come to an
      understanding with Walpole, and offered, if he would use his influence
      with the King in their favour, to screen him from prosecution. They even
      went so far as to engage for the concurrence of the Prince of Wales. But
      Walpole knew that the assistance of the Boys, as he called the young
      Patriots, would avail him nothing if Pulteney and Carteret should prove
      intractable, and would be superfluous if the great leaders of the
      Opposition could be gained. He, therefore, declined the proposal. It is
      remarkable that Mr. Thackeray, who has thought it worth while to preserve
      Pitt&rsquo;s bad college verses, has not even alluded to this story, a story
      which is supported by strong testimony, and which may be found in so
      common a book as Coxe&rsquo;s Life of Walpole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new arrangements disappointed almost every member of the Opposition,
      and none more than Pitt. He was not invited to become a placeman; and he
      <span class="pagenum">218</span><a name="link218" id="link218"></a>therefore
      stuck firmly to his old trade of patriot. Fortunate it was for him that he
      did so. Had he taken office at this time, he would in all probability have
      shared largely in the unpopularity of Pulteney, Sandys, and Carteret. He
      was now the fiercest and most implacable of those who called for vengeance
      on Walpole. He spoke with great energy and ability in favour of the most
      unjust and violent propositions which the enemies of the fallen minister
      could invent. He urged the House of Commons to appoint a secret tribunal
      for the purpose of investigating the conduct of the late First Lord of the
      Treasury. This was done. The great majority of the inquisitors were
      notoriously hostile to the accused statesman. Yet they were compelled to
      own that they could find no fault in him. They therefore called for new
      powers, for a bill of indemnity to witnesses, or, in plain words, for a
      bill to reward all who might give evidence, true or false, against the
      Earl of Orford. This bill Pitt supported, Pitt, who had himself offered to
      be a screen between Lord Orford and public justice. These are melancholy
      facts. Mr. Thackeray omits them, or hurries over them as fast as he can;
      and, as eulogy is his business, he is in the right to do so. But, though
      there are many parts of the life of Pitt which it is more agreeable to
      contemplate, we know none more instructive. What must have been the
      general state of political morality, when a young man, considered, and
      justly considered, as the most public-spirited and spotless statesman of
      his time, could attempt to force his way into office by means so
      disgraceful!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bill of Indemnity was rejected by the Lords. Walpole withdrew himself
      quietly from the public eye: and the ample space which he had left vacant
      was soon <span class="pagenum">210</span><a name="link210" id="link210_"></a>occupied
      by Carteret. Against Carteret Pitt began to thunder with as much zeal as
      he had ever manifested against Sir Robert. To Carteret he transferred most
      of the hard names which were familiar to his eloquence, sole minister,
      wicked minister, odious minister, execrable minister. The chief topic of
      Pitt&rsquo;s invective was the favour shown to the German dominions of the House
      of Brunswick. He attacked with great violence, and with an ability which
      raised him to the very first rank among the parliamentary speakers, the
      practice of paying Hanoverian troops with English money. The House of
      Commons had lately lost some of its most distinguished ornaments. Walpole
      and Pulteney had accepted peerages; Sir William Wynd-ham was dead; and
      among the rising men none could be considered as, on the whole, a match
      for Pitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the recess of 1744, the old Duchess of Marlborough died. She
      carried to her grave the reputation of being decidedly the best hater of
      her time. Yet her love had been infinitely more destructive than her
      hatred. More than thirty years before, her temper had ruined the party to
      which she belonged and the husband whom she adored. Time had made her
      neither wiser nor kinder. Whoever was at any moment great and prosperous
      was the object of her fiercest detestation. She had hated Walpole; she now
      hated Carteret. Pope, long before her death, predicted the fate of her
      vast property. <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"To heirs unknown descends
      the unguarded store, <br /><span class="indent15">Or wanders,
      heaven-directed, to the poor.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt was then one of the poor; and to him Heaven directed a portion of the
      wealth of the haughty Dowager. She left him a legacy of ten thousand
      pounds, in consideration of &ldquo;the noble defence he had made <span
      class="pagenum">220</span><a name="link220" id="link220"></a>for the
      support of the laws of England, and to prevent the ruin of his country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The will was made in August. The Duchess died in October. In November Pitt
      was a courtier. The Pelhams had forced the King, much against his will, to
      part with Lord Carteret, who had now become Earl Granville. They
      proceeded, after this victory, to form the Government on that basis,
      called by the cant name of &ldquo;the broad bottom.&rdquo; Lyttelton had a seat at the
      Treasury, and several other friends of Pitt were provided for. But Pitt
      himself was, for the present, forced to be content with promises. The King
      resented most highly some expression which the ardent orator had used in
      the debate on the Hanoverian troops. But Newcastle and Pelham expressed
      the strongest confidence that time and their exertions would soften the
      royal displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt, on his part, omitted nothing that might facilitate his admission to
      office. He resigned his place in the household of Prince Frederic, and,
      when Parliament met, exerted his eloquence in support of the Government.
      The Pelhams were really sincere in their endeavours to remove the strong
      prejudices which had taken root in the King&rsquo;s mind. They knew that Pitt
      was not a man to be deceived with ease or offended with impunity. They
      were afraid that they should not be long able to put him off with
      promises. Nor was it their interest so to put him off. There was a strong
      tie between him and them. He was the enemy of their enemy. The brothers
      hated and dreaded the eloquent, aspiring, and imperious Granville. They
      had traced his intrigues in many quarters. They knew his influence over
      the royal mind. They knew that, as soon as a favourable opportunity
      should, arrive, <span class="pagenum">221</span><a name="link221"
       id="link221"></a>he would be recalled to the head of affairs. They
      resolved to bring things to a crisis; and the question on which they took
      issue with their master was, whether Pitt should or should not be admitted
      to office. They chose their time with more skill than generosity. It was
      when rebellion was actually raging in Britain, when the Pretender was
      master of the northern extremity of the island, that they tendered their
      resignations. The King found himself deserted, in one day, by the whole
      strength of that party which had placed his family on the throne. Lord
      Granville tried to form a government; but it soon appeared that the
      parliamentary interest of the Pelhams was irresistible, and that the
      King&rsquo;s favourite statesman could count only on about thirty Lords and
      eighty members of the House of Commons. The scheme was given up. Granville
      went away laughing. The ministers came back stronger than ever; and the
      King was now no longer able to refuse any thing that they might be pleased
      to demand. He could only mutter that it was very hard that Newcastle, who
      was not fit to ha chamberlain to the most insignificant prince in Germany,
      should dictate to the King of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      One concession the ministers graciously made. They agreed that Pitt should
      not be placed in a situation in which it would be necessary for him to
      have frequent interviews with the King. Instead, therefore, of making
      their new ally Secretary-at-War as they had intended, they appointed him
      Vice-Treasurer of Ireland, and in a few months promoted him to the office
      of Paymaster of the Forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was, at that time, one of the most lucrative offices in the
      Government. The salary was but a small part of the emolument which the
      Paymaster derived <span class="pagenum">222</span><a name="link222"
       id="link222"></a>from his place. He was allowed to keep a large sum,
      which, even in time of peace, was seldom less than one hundred thousand
      pounds, constantly in his hands; and the interest on this sum he might
      appropriate to his own use. This practice was not secret, nor was it
      considered as disreputable. It was the practice of men of undoubted
      honour, both before and after the time of Pitt. He, however, refused to
      accept one farthing beyond the salary which the law had annexed to his
      office. It had been usual for foreign princes who received the pay of
      England to give to the Paymaster of the Forces a small percentage on the
      subsidies. These ignominious vails Pitt resolutely declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disinterestedness of this kind was, in his days, very rare. His conduct
      surprised and amused politicians. It excited the warmest admiration
      throughout the body of the people. In spite of the inconsistencies of
      which Pitt had been guilty, in spite of the strange contrast between his
      violence in Opposition and his tameness in office, he still possessed a
      large share of the public confidence. The motives which may lead a
      politician to change his connections or his general line of conduct are
      often obscure; but disinterestedness in pecuniary matters everybody can
      understand. Pitt was thenceforth considered as a man who was proof to all
      sordid temptations. If he acted ill, it might be from an error in
      judgment; it might be from resentment; it might be from ambition. But poor
      as he was, he had vindicated himself from all suspicion of covetousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight quiet years followed, eight years during which the minority, which
      had been feeble ever since Lord Granville had been overthrown, continued
      to dwindle till it became almost invisible. Peace was made with France and
      Spain in 1748. Prince Frederic died in 1751; <span class="pagenum">223</span><a
      name="link223" id="link223"></a>and with him died the very semblance of
      opposition. All the most distinguished survivors of the party which had
      supported Walpole and of the party which had opposed him were united under
      his successor. The fiery and vehement spirit of Pitt had for a time been
      laid to rest. He silently acquiesced in that very system of continental
      measures which he had lately condemned. He ceased to talk disrespectfully
      about Hanover. He did not object to the treaty with Spain, though that
      treaty left us exactly where we had been when he uttered his
      spirit-stirring harangues against the pacific policy of Walpole. Now and
      then glimpses of his former self appeared; but they were few and
      transient. Pelham knew with whom he had to deal, and felt that an ally, so
      little used to control, and so capable of inflicting injury, might well be
      indulged in an occasional fit of waywardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two men, little, if at all, inferior to Pitt in powers of mind, held, like
      him, subordinate offices in the Government. One of these, Murray, was
      successively Solicitor-General and Attorney-General. This distinguished
      person far surpassed Pitt in correctness of taste, in power of reasoning,
      in depth and variety of knowledge. His parliamentary eloquence never
      blazed into sudden flashes of dazzling brilliancy; but its clear, placid,
      and mellow splendour was never for an instant overclouded. Intellectually
      he was, we believe, fully equal to Pitt; but he was deficient in the moral
      qualities to which Pitt owed most of his success. Murray wanted the
      energy, the courage, the all-grasping and all-risking ambition, which make
      men great in stirring times. His heart was a little cold, his temper
      cautious even to timidity, his manners decorous even to formality. He
      never exposed his fortunes or his fame to any <span class="pagenum">224</span><a
      name="link224" id="link224"></a>risk which he could avoid. At one time he
      might, in all probability, have been Prime Minister. But the object of his
      wishes was the judicial bench. The situation of Chief Justice might not be
      so splendid as that of First Lord of the Treasury; but it was dignified;
      it was quiet; it was secure; and therefore it was the favourite situation
      of Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fox, the father of the great man whose mighty efforts in the cause of
      peace, of truth, and of liberty, have made that name immortal, was
      Secretary-at-War. He was a favourite with the King, with the Duke of
      Cumberland, and with some of the most powerful members of the great Whig
      connection. His parliamentary talents were of the highest order. As a
      speaker he was in almost all respects the very opposite to Pitt. His
      figure was ungraceful; his face, as Reynolds and Nollekens have preserved
      it to us, indicated a strong understanding; but the features were coarse,
      and the general aspect dark and lowering. His manner was awkward; his
      delivery was hesitating; he was often at a stand for want of a word; but
      as a debater, as a master of that keen, weighty, manly logic, v Inch is
      suited to the discussion of political questions, he has perhaps never been
      surpassed except by his son. In reply he was as decidedly superior to Pitt
      as in declamation he was Pitt&rsquo;s inferior. Intellectually the balance was
      nearly even between the rivals. But here, again, the moral qualities of
      Pitt turned the scale. Fox had undoubtedly many virtues. In natural
      disposition as well as in talents, he bore a great resemblance to his more
      celebrated son. He had the same sweetness of &lsquo;temper, the same strong
      passions, the same openness, boldness, and impetuosity, the same
      cordiality towards friends, the same placability towards enemies. No man
      <span class="pagenum">225</span><a name="link225" id="link225"></a>was
      more warmly or justly beloved by his family or by his associates. But
      unhappily he had been trained in a bad political school, in a school, the
      doctrines of which were, that political virtue is the mere coquetry of
      political prostitution, that every patriot has his price, that Government
      can be carried on only by means of corruption, and that the state is given
      as a prey to statesmen. These maxims were too much in vogue throughout the
      lower ranks of Walpole&rsquo;s party, and were too much encouraged by Walpole
      himself, who, from contempt of what is in our day vulgarly called humbug,
      often ran extravagantly and offensively into the opposite extreme. The
      loose political morality of Fox presented a remarkable contrast to the
      ostentatious purity of Pitt. The nation distrusted the former, and placed
      implicit confidence in the latter. But almost all the statesmen of the age
      had still to learn that the confidence of the nation was worth having.
      While things went on quietly, while there was no opposition, while every
      thing was given by the favour of a small ruling junto, Fox had a decided
      advantage over Pitt; but when dangerous times came, when Europe was
      convulsed with war, when Parliament was broken up into factions, when the
      public mind was violently excited, the favourite of the people rose to
      supreme power, while his rival sank into insignificance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the year 1754 Henry Pelham died unexpectedly. &ldquo;Now I shall have
      no more peace,&rdquo; exclaimed the old King, when he heard the news. He was in
      the right. Pelham had succeeded in bringing together and keeping together
      all the talents of the kingdom. By his death, the highest post to which an
      English subject can aspire was left vacant; and at the same moment, the
      influence which had yoked together and <span class="pagenum">226</span><a
      name="link226" id="link226"></a>reigned in so many turbulent and ambitious
      spirits was withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a week after Pelham&rsquo;s death, it was determined that the Duke of
      Newcastle should be placed at the head of the treasury; but the
      arrangement was still far from complete. Who was to be the leading
      Minister of the Crown in the House of Commons? Was the office to be
      intrusted to a man of eminent talents? And would not such a man in such a
      place demand and obtain a larger share of power and patronage than
      Newcastle would be disposed to concede? Was a mere drudge to be employed?
      And what probability was there that a mere drudge would be able to manage
      a large and stormy assembly, abounding with able and experienced men?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope has said of that wretched miser Sir John Cutler, <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">"Cutler saw tenants break and houses fall <br /><span
      class="indent20">For very want: he could not build a wall.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Newcastle&rsquo;s love of power resembled Cutler&rsquo;s love of money. It was an
      avarice which thwarted itself, a penny-wise and pound-foolish cupidity. An
      immediate outlay was so painful to him that he would not venture to make
      the most desirable improvement. If he could have found it in his heart to
      cede at once a portion of his authority, he might probably have ensured
      the continuance of what remained. But he thought it better to construct a
      weak and rotten government, which tottered at the smallest breath, and
      lull in the first storm, than to pay the necessary price for sound and
      durable materials. He wished to find some person who would be willing to
      accept the lead of the House of Commons on terms similar to those on which
      Secretary Craggs had acted under Sunderland, <span class="pagenum">227</span><a
      name="link227" id="link227"></a>five-and-thirty years before. Craggs could
      hardly be called a minister. He was a mere agent for the Minister. He was
      not trusted with the higher secrets of state, but obeyed implicitly the
      directions of his superior, and was, to use Doddington&rsquo;s expression,
      merely Lord Sunderland&rsquo;s man. But times were changed. Since the days of
      Sunderland, the importance of the House of Commons had been constantly on
      the increase. During many years, the person who conducted the business of
      the Government in that blouse had almost always been Prime Minister. In
      these circumstances, it was not to be supposed that any person who
      possessed the talents necessary for the situation would stoop to accept it
      on such terms as Newcastle was disposed to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt was ill at Bath; and, had he been well and in London, neither the
      King nor Newcastle would have been disposed to make any overtures to him.
      The cool and wary Murray had set his heart on professional objects.
      Negotiations were opened with Fox. Newcastle behaved like himself, that is
      to say, childishly and basely. The proposition which he made was that Fox
      should be Secretary of State, with the lead of the House of Commons; that
      the disposal of the secret-service money, or, in plain words, the business
      of buying members of Parliament, should be left to the First Lord of the
      Treasury; but that Fox should be exactly informed of the way in which this
      fund was employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these conditions Fox assented. But the next day every thing was in
      confusion. Newcastle had changed his mind. The conversation which took
      place between Fox and the Duke is one of the most curious in English
      history. &ldquo;My brother,&rdquo; said Newcastle, &ldquo;when he was at the Treasury, never
      told anybody <span class="pagenum">228</span><a name="link228" id="link228"></a>what
      he did with the secret-service money. No more will I.&rdquo; The answer was
      obvious. Pelham had been, not only First Lord of the Treasury, but also
      manager of the House of Commons; and it was therefore unnecessary for him
      to confide to any other person his dealings with the members of that
      House. &ldquo;But how,&rdquo;&rsquo; said Fox, &ldquo;can I lead in the Commons without
      information on this head? How can I talk to gentlemen when I do not know
      which of them have received gratifications and which have not? And who,&rdquo;
       he continued, &ldquo;is to have the disposal of places?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I myself,&rdquo; said
      the Duke.&mdash;&ldquo;How then am I to manage the House of Commons?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,
      let the members of the House of Commons come to me.&rdquo; Fox then mentioned
      the general election which was approaching, and asked how the ministerial
      boroughs were to be filled up. &ldquo;Do not trouble yourself,&rdquo; said Newcastle;
      &ldquo;that is all settled.&rdquo; This was too much for human nature to bear. Fox
      refused to accept the Secretaryship of State on such terms; and the Duke
      confided the management of the House of Commons to a dull, harmless man,
      whose name is almost forgotten in our time, Sir Thomas Robinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pitt returned from Bath he affected great moderation, though his
      haughty soul was boiling with resentment. He did not complain of the
      manner in which he had been passed by, but said openly that, in his
      opinion, Fox was the fittest man to lead the House of Commons. The rivals,
      reconciled by their common interest and their common enmities, concerted a
      plan of operations for the next session. &ldquo;Sir Thomas Robinson lead us!&rdquo;
       said Pitt to Fox. &ldquo;The Duke might as well send his jack-boot to lead us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elections of 1754 were favourable to the administration. <span
      class="pagenum">229</span><a name="link229" id="link229"></a>But the
      aspect of foreign affairs was threatening. In India the English and the
      French had been employed, ever since the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in
      cutting each other&rsquo;s throats. They had lately taken to the same practice
      in America. It might have been foreseen that stirring times were at hand,
      times which would call for abilities very different from those of
      Newcastle and Robinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      In November the Parliament met; and before the end of that month the new
      Secretary of State had been so unmercifully baited by the Paymaster of the
      Forces and the Secretary at War that he was thoroughly sick of his
      situation. Fox attacked him with great force and acrimony. Pitt affected a
      kind of contemptuous tenderness for Sir Thomas, and directed his attacks
      principally against Newcastle. On one occasion he asked in tones of
      thunder whether Parliament sat only to register the edicts of one too
      powerful subject? The Duke was scared out of his wits. He was afraid to
      dismiss the mutineers; he was afraid to promote them; but it was
      absolutely necessary to do something. Fox, as the less proud and
      intractable of the refractory pair, was preferred. A seat in the Cabinet
      was offered to him on condition that he would give efficient support to
      the ministry in Parliament. In an evil hour for his fame and his fortunes
      he accepted the offer, and abandoned his connection with Pitt, who never
      forgave this desertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas, assisted by Fox, contrived to get through the business of the
      year without much trouble. Pitt was waiting his time. The negotiations
      pending between France and England took every day a more unfavourable
      aspect. Towards the close of the session the King sent a message to inform
      the House of Commons <span class="pagenum">230</span><a name="link230"
       id="link230"></a>that he had found it necessary to make preparations for
      war. The House returned an address of thanks, and passed a vote of credit.
      During the recess, the old animosity of both nations was inflamed by a
      series of disastrous events. An English force was cut off in America; and
      several French merchantmen were taken in the West Indian seas. It was
      plain that an appeal to arms was at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first object of the King was to secure Hanover; and Newcastle was
      disposed to gratify his master. Treaties were concluded, after the fashion
      of those times, with several petty German princes, who bound themselves to
      find soldiers if England would find money; and, as it was suspected that
      Frederic the Second had set his heart on the electoral dominions of his
      uncle, Russia was hired to keep Prussia in awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the stipulations of these treaties were made known, there arose
      throughout the kingdom a murmur from which a judicious observer might
      easily prognosticate the approach of a tempest. Newcastle encountered
      strong opposition, even from those whom he had always considered as his
      tools. Legge, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, refused to sign the
      Treasury warrants which were necessary to give effect to the treaties.
      Those persons who were supposed to possess the confidence of the young
      Prince of Wales and of his mother held very menacing language. In this
      perplexity Newcastle sent for Pitt, hugged him, patted him, smirked at
      him, wept over him, and lisped out the highest compliments and the most
      splendid promises. The King, who had hitherto been as sulky as possible,
      would be civil to him at the levee; he should be brought into the Cabinet;
      he should be consulted about every thing; if he would only be as good as
      to support <span class="pagenum">231</span><a name="link231" id="link231"></a>the
      Hessian subsidy in the House of Commons. Pitt coldly declined the
      proffered seat in the Cabinet, expressed the highest love and reverence
      for the King, and said that, if his Majesty felt a strong personal
      interest in the Hessian treaty he would so far deviate from the line which
      he had traced out for himself as to give that treaty his support. &ldquo;Well,
      and the Russian subsidy,&rdquo; said Newcastle. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Pitt, &ldquo;not a system
      of subsidies.&rdquo; The Duke summoned Lord Hardwicke to his aid; but Pitt was
      inflexible. Murray would do nothing. Robinson could do nothing. It was
      necessary to have recourse to Fox. He became Secretary of State, with the
      full authority of a leader in the House of Commons; and Sir Thomas was
      pensioned off on the Irish establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In November, 1755, the Houses met. Public expectation was wound up to the
      height. After ten quiet years there was to be an Opposition countenanced
      by the heir apparent of the throne, and headed by the most brilliant
      orator of the age. The debate on the address was long remembered as one of
      the greatest parliamentary conflicts of that generation. It began at three
      in the afternoon, and lasted till five the next morning. It was on this
      night that Gerard Hamilton delivered that single speech from which his
      nickname was derived. His eloquence threw into the shade every orator
      except Pitt, who declaimed against the subsidies for an hour and a half
      with extraordinary energy and effect. Those powers which had formerly
      spread terror through the majorities of Walpole and Carteret were now
      displayed in their highest perfection before an audience long unaccustomed
      to such exhibitions. One fragment of this celebrated oration remains in a
      state of tolerable preservation. It is <span class="pagenum">232</span><a
      name="link232" id="link232"></a>the comparison between the coalition of
      Fox and Newcastle, and the junction of the Rhone and the Saone. &ldquo;At
      Lyons,&rdquo;&rsquo; said Pitt, &ldquo;I was taken to see the place where the two rivers
      meet, the one gentle, feeble, languid, and, though languid, yet of no
      depth, the other a boisterous and impetuous torrent: but different as they
      are, they meet at last.&rdquo; The amendment moved by the Opposition was
      rejected by a great majority; and Pitt and Legge were immediately
      dismissed from their offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      During several months the contest in the House of Commons was extremely
      sharp. Warm debates took place on the estimates, debates still warmer on
      the subsidiary treaties. The Government succeeded in every division; but
      the fame of Pitt&rsquo;s eloquence, and the influence of his lofty and
      determined character, continued to increase through the Session; and the
      events which followed the prorogation made it utterly impossible for any
      other person to manage the Parliament or the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war began in every part of the world with events disastrous to
      England, and even more shameful than disastrous. But the most humiliating
      of these events was the loss of Minorca. The Duke of Richelieu, an old fop
      who had passed his life from sixteen to sixty in seducing women for whom
      he cared not one straw, landed on that island, and succeeded in reducing
      it. Admiral Byng was sent from Gibraltar to throw succours into
      Port-Mahon; but he did not think fit to engage the French squadron, and
      sailed back without having effected his purpose. The people were inflamed
      to madness. A storm broke forth, which appalled even those who remembered
      the days of Excise and of South-Sea. The shops were filled <span
      class="pagenum">233</span><a name="link233" id="link233"></a>with libels
      and caricatures. The walls were covered with placards. The city of London
      called for vengeance, and the cry was echoed from every corner of the
      kingdom. Dorsetshire, Huntingdonshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire,
      Somersetshire, Lancashire, Suffolk, Shropshire, Surry, sent up strong
      addresses to the throne, and instructed their representatives to vote for
      a strict inquiry into the causes of the late disasters. In the great towns
      the feeling was as strong as in the counties. In some of the instructions
      it was even recommended that the supplies should be stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nation was in a state of angry and sullen despondency, almost
      unparalleled in history. People have, in all ages, been in the habit of
      talking about the good old times of their ancestors, and the degeneracy of
      their contemporaries. This is in general merely a cant. But in 1756 it was
      something more. At this time appeared Brown&rsquo;s Estimate, a book now
      remembered only by the allusions in Cowper&rsquo;s Table Talk and in Burke&rsquo;s
      Letters on a Regicide Peace. It was universally read, admired, and
      believed. The author fully convinced his readers that they were a race of
      cowards and scoundrels; that nothing could save them; that they were on
      the point of being enslaved by their enemies, and that they richly
      deserved their fate. Such were the speculations to which ready credence
      was given at the outset of the most glorious war in which England had ever
      been engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newcastle now began to tremble for his place, and for the only thing which
      was dearer to him than his place, his neck. The people were not in a mood
      to be trifled with. Their cry was for blood. For this once they might be
      contented with the sacrifice of Byng. But what if fresh disasters should
      take place? What <span class="pagenum">234</span><a name="link234"
       id="link234"></a>if an unfriendly sovereign should ascend the throne? What
      if a hostile House of Commons should be chosen?
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, in October, the decisive crisis came, the new Secretary of
      State had been long sick of the perfidy and levity of the First Lord of
      the Treasury, and began to fear that he might be made a scapegoat to save
      the old intriguer who, imbecile as he seemed, never wanted dexterity where
      danger was to be avoided. Fox threw up his office. Newcastle had recourse
      to Murray; but Murray had now within his reach the favourite object of his
      ambition. The situation of Chief-Justice of the King&rsquo;s Bench was vacant;
      and the Attorney-General was fully resolved to obtain it, or to go into
      Opposition. Newcastle offered him any terms, the Duchy of Lancaster for
      life, a tellership of the Exchequer, any amount of pension, two thousand a
      year, six thousand a year. When the Ministers found that Murray&rsquo;s mind was
      made up, they pressed for delay, the delay of a session, a month, a week,
      a day. Would he only make his appearance once more in the House of
      Commons? Would he only speak in favour of the address? He was inexorable,
      and peremptorily said that they might give or withhold the
      Chief-Justiceship, but that he would be Attorney-General no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newcastle now contrived to overcome the prejudices of the King, and
      overtures were made to Pitt, through Lord Hardwicke. Pitt knew his power,
      and showed that he knew it. He demanded as an indispensable condition that
      Newcastle should be altogether excluded from the new arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke was in a state of ludicrous distress. He ran about chattering and
      crying, asking advice and listening to none. In the mean time, the Session
      drew near. The public excitement was unabated. Nobody <span class="pagenum">235</span><a
      name="link235" id="link235"></a>could be found to face Pitt and Fox in the
      House of Commons. Newcastle&rsquo;s heart failed him, and he tendered his
      resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King; sent for Fox, and directed him to form the plan of an
      administration in concert with Pitt. But Pitt had not forgotten old
      injuries, and positively refused to act with Fox.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King now applied to the Duke of Devonshire, and this mediator
      succeeded in making an arrangement. He consented to take the Treasury.
      Pitt became Secretary of State, with the lead of the House of Commons. The
      Great Seal was put into commission. Legge returned to the Exchequer; and
      Lord Temple, whose sister Pitt had lately married, was placed at the head
      of the Admiralty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear from the first that this administration would last but a very
      short time. It lasted not quite five months; and, during those five
      months, Pitt and Lord Temple were treated with rudeness by the King, and
      found but feeble support in the House of Commons. It is a remarkable fact,
      that the Opposition prevented the re-election of some of the new
      Ministers. Pitt, who sat for one of the boroughs which were in the Pelham
      interest, found some difficulty in obtaining a seat after his acceptance
      of the seals. So destitute was the new Government of that sort of
      influence without which no Government could then be durable. One of the
      arguments most frequently urged against the Reform Bill was that, under a
      system of popular representation, men whose presence in the House of
      Commons was necessary to the conducting of public business might often
      find it impossible to find seats. Should this inconvenience ever be felt,
      there cannot be the slightest difficulty in devising and applying a
      remedy. But those <span class="pagenum">236</span><a name="link236"
       id="link236"></a>who threatened us with this evil ought to have remembered
      that, under the old system, a great man called to power at a great crisis
      by the voice of the whole nation was in danger of being excluded, by an
      aristocratical cabal, from that House of which he was the most
      distinguished ornament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important event of this short administration was the trial of
      Byng. On that subject public opinion is still divided. We think the
      punishment of the Admiral altogether unjust and absurd. Treachery,
      cowardice, ignorance amounting to what lawyers have called <i>crassa
      ignorantia</i>, are fit objects of severe penal inflictions. But Byng was
      not found guilty of treachery, of cowardice, or of gross ignorance of his
      profession He died for doing what the most loyal subject, the most
      intrepid warrior, the most experienced seaman, might have done. He died
      for an error in judgment, an error such as the greatest commanders,
      Frederic, Napoleon, Wellington, have often committed, and have often
      acknowledged. Such errors are not proper objects of punishment, for this
      reason, that the punishing of such errors tends not to prevent them, but
      to produce them. The dread of an ignominious death may stimulate
      sluggishness to exertion, may keep a traitor to his standard, may prevent
      a coward from running away, but it has no tendency to bring out those
      qualities which enable men to form prompt and judicious decisions in great
      emergencies. The best marksman may be expected to fail when the apple
      which is to be his mark is set on his child&rsquo;s head. We cannot conceive any
      thing more likely to deprive an officer of his self-possession at the time
      when he most needs it than the knowledge that, if the judgment of his
      superiors should not agree with his, he will be executed with <span
      class="pagenum">237</span><a name="link237" id="link237"></a>every
      circumstance of shame. Queens, it has often been said, run far greater
      risk in childbed than private women, merely because their medical
      attendants are more anxious. The surgeon who attended Marie Louise was
      altogether unnerved by his emotions. &ldquo;Compose yourself,&rdquo; said Bonaparte;
      &ldquo;imagine that you are assisting a poor girl in the Faubourg Saint
      Antoine.&rdquo; This was surely a far wiser course than that of the Eastern king
      in the Arabian Knights&rsquo; Entertainments, who proclaimed that the physicians
      who failed to cure his daughter should have their heads chopped off.
      Bonaparte knew mankind well; and, as he acted towards this surgeon, he
      acted towards his officers. No sovereign was ever so indulgent to mere
      errors of judgment; and it is certain that no sovereign ever had in his
      service so many military men fit for the highest commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt acted a brave and honest part on this occasion. He ventured to put
      both his power and his popularity to hazard, and spoke manfully for Byng,
      both in Parliament and in the royal presence. But the King was inexorable.
      &ldquo;The House of Commons, Sir,&rdquo; said Pitt, &ldquo;seems inclined to mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered the King, &ldquo;you have taught me to look for the sense of my
      people in other places than the House of Commons.&rdquo; The saying has more
      point than most of those which are recorded of George the Second, and,
      though sarcastically meant, contains a high and just compliment to Pitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King disliked Pitt, but absolutely hated Temple. The new Secretary of
      State, his Majesty said, had never read Vatel, and was tedious and
      pompous, but respectful. The First Lord of the Admiralty was grossly
      impertinent. Walpole tells one story, which, <span class="pagenum">238</span><a
      name="link238" id="link238"></a>we fear, is much too good to be true. He
      assures us that Temple entertained his royal master with an elaborate
      parallel between Byng&rsquo;s behaviour at Minorca, and his Majesty&rsquo;s behaviour
      at Oudenarde, in which the advantage was all on the side of the Admiral.
    </p>
    <p>
      This state of things could not last. Early in April, Pitt and all his
      friends were turned out, and Newcastle was summoned to St. James&rsquo;s. But
      the public discontent was not extinguished. It had subsided when Pitt was
      called to power. But it still glowed under the embers; and it now burst at
      once into a flame. The stocks fell. The Common Council met. The freedom of
      the city was voted to Pitt. All the greatest corporate towns followed the
      example. &ldquo;For some weeks,&rdquo; says Walpole, &ldquo;it rained gold boxes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the turning point of Pitt&rsquo;s life. It might have been expected
      that a man of so haughty and vehement a nature, treated so ungraciously by
      the Court, and supported so enthusiastically by the people, would have
      eagerly taken the first opportunity of showing his power and gratifying
      his resentment; and an opportunity was not wanting. The members for many
      counties and large towns had been instructed to vote for an inquiry into
      the circumstances which had produced the miscarriage of the preceding
      year. A motion for inquiry had been carried in the House of Commons,
      without opposition; and, a few days after Pitt&rsquo;s dismissal, the
      investigation commenced. Newcastle and his colleagues obtained a vote of
      acquittal; but the minority were so strong that they could not venture to
      ask for a vote of approbation, as they had at first intended; and it was
      thought by some shrewd observers that, if Pitt had exerted himself <span
      class="pagenum">239</span><a name="link239" id="link239"></a>to the utmost
      of his power, the inquiry might have ended in a censure, if not in an
      impeachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt showed on this occasion a moderation and selfgovernment which was not
      habitual to him. He had found by experience, that he could not stand
      alone. His eloquence and his popularity had done much, very much for him.
      Without rank, without fortune, without borough interest, hated by the
      King, hated by the aristocracy, he was a person of the first importance in
      the state. He had been suffered to form a ministry, and to pronounce
      sentence of exclusion on all his rivals, on the most powerful nobleman of
      the Whig party, on the ablest debater in the House of Commons. And he now
      found that he had gone too far. The English Constitution was not, indeed,
      without a popular element. But other elements generally predominated. The
      confidence and admiration of the nation might make a statesman formidable
      at the head of an Opposition, might load him with framed and glazed
      parchments and gold boxes, might possibly, under very peculiar
      circumstances, such as those of the preceding year, raise him for a time
      to power. But, constituted as Parliament then was, the favourite of the
      people could not depend on a majority in the people&rsquo;s own House. The Duke
      of Newcastle, however contemptible in morals, manners, and understanding,
      was a dangerous enemy. His rank, his wealth, his unrivalled parliamentary
      interest, would alone have made him important. But this was not all. The
      Whig aristocracy regarded him as their leader. His long possession of
      power had given him a kind of prescriptive right to possess it still. The
      House of Commons had been elected when he was at the head of affairs. The
      members for the ministerial boroughs had all been <span class="pagenum">240</span><a
      name="link240" id="link240"></a>nominated by him. The public offices
      swarmed with his creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt desired power; and he desired it, we really believe, from high and
      generous motives. He was, in the strict sense of the word, a patriot. He
      had none of that philanthropy which the great French writers of his time
      preached to all the nations of Europe. He loved England as an Athenian
      loved the City of the Violet Crown, as a Roman loved the City of the Seven
      Hills. He saw his country insulted and defeated. He saw the national
      spirit sinking. Yet he knew what the resources of the empire, vigorously
      employed, could effect; and he felt that he was the man to employ them
      vigorously. &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; he said to the Duke of Devonshire, &ldquo;I am sure that
      I can save this country, and that nobody else can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Desiring, then, to be in power, and feeling that his abilities and the
      public confidence were not alone sufficient to keep him in power against
      the wishes of the Court and of the aristocracy, he began to think of a
      coalition with Newcastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newcastle was equally disposed to a reconciliation. He, too, had profited
      by his recent experience. He had found that the Court and the aristocracy,
      though powerful, were not every thing in the state. A strong oligarchical
      connection, a great borough interest, ample patronage, and secret-service
      money, might, in quiet times, be all that a Minister needed; but it was
      unsafe to trust wholly to such support in time of war, of discontent, and
      of agitation. The composition of the House of Commons was not wholly
      aristocratical; and, whatever be the composition of large deliberative
      assemblies, their spirit is always in some degree popular. Where there are
      free debates, eloquence must have <span class="pagenum">241</span><a
      name="link241" id="link241"></a>admirers, and reason must make converts.
      Where there is a free press, the governors must live in constant awe of
      the opinions of the governed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus these two men, so unlike in character, so lately mortal enemies, were
      necessary to each other. Newcastle had fallen in November, for want of
      that public confidence which Pitt possessed, and of that parliamentary
      support which Pitt was better qualified than any man of his time to give.
      Pitt had fallen in April, for want of that species of influence which
      Newcastle had passed his whole life in acquiring and hoarding. Neither of
      them had power enough to support himself. Each of them had power enough to
      overturn the other. Their union would be irresistible. Neither the King
      nor any party in the state would be able to stand against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances, Pitt was not disposed to proceed to extremities
      against his predecessors in office. Something, however, was due to
      consistency; and something was necessary for the preservation of his
      popularity. He did little; but that little he did in such a manner as to
      produce great effect. He came down to the House in all the pomp of gout,
      his legs swathed in flannels, his arm dangling in a sling. He kept his
      seat through several fatiguing days, in spite of pain and languor. He
      uttered a few sharp and vehement sentences; but during the greater part of
      the discussion, his language was unusually gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the inquiry had terminated without a vote either of approbation or of
      censure, the great obstacle to a coalition was removed. Many obstacles,
      however, remained. The King was still rejoicing in his deliverance from
      the proud and aspiring Minister who had been forced on him by the cry of
      the nation. His <span class="pagenum">242</span><a name="link242"
       id="link242"></a>Majesty&rsquo;s indignation was excited to the highest point
      when it appeared that Newcastle, who had, during thirty years, been loaded
      with marks of royal favour, and who had bound himself, by a solemn
      promise, never to coalesce with Pitt, was meditating a new perfidy. Of all
      the statesmen of that age, Fox had the largest share of royal favour. A
      coalition between Fox and Newcastle was the arrangement which the King
      wished to bring about. But the Duke was too cunning to fall into such a
      snare. As a speaker in Parliament, Fox might perhaps be, on the whole, as
      useful to an administration as his great rival; but he was one of the most
      unpopular men in England. Then, again, Newcastle felt all that jealousy of
      Fox, which, according to the proverb, generally exists between two of a
      trade. Fox would certainly intermeddle with that department which the Duke
      was most desirous to reserve entire to himself, the jobbing department.
      Pitt, on the other hand, was quite willing to leave the drudgery of
      corruption to any who might be inclined to undertake it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During eleven weeks England remained without a ministry; and in the mean
      time Parliament was sitting, and a war was raging. The prejudices of the
      King, the haughtiness of Pitt, the jealousy, levity, and treachery of
      Newcastle, delayed the settlement. Pitt knew the Duke too well to trust
      him without security. The Duke loved power too much to be inclined to give
      security. While they were haggling, the King was in vain attempting to
      produce a final rupture between them, or to form a Government without
      them. At one time he applied to Lord Waldgrave, an honest and sensible
      man, but unpractised in affairs. Lord Waldgrave had the courage to accept
      the Treasury, <span class="pagenum">243</span><a name="link243"
       id="link243"></a>but soon found that no administration formed by him had
      the smallest chance of standing a single week.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the King&rsquo;s pertinacity yielded to the necessity of the case.
      After exclaiming with great bitterness, and with some justice, against the
      Whigs, who ought, he said, to be ashamed to talk about liberty while they
      submitted to the footmen of the Duke of Newcastle, his Majesty submitted.
      The influence of Leicester House prevailed on Pitt to abate a little, and
      but a little, of his high demands; and all at once, out of the chaos in
      which parties had for some time been rising, falling, meeting, separating,
      arose a government as strong at home as that of Pelham, as successful
      abroad as that of Godolphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newcastle took the Treasury. Pitt was Secretary of State, with the lead in
      the House of Commons, and with the supreme direction of the war and of
      foreign affairs. Fox, the only man who could have given much annoyance to
      the new Government, was silenced with the office of Paymaster, which,
      during the continuance of that war, was probably the most lucrative place
      in the whole Government. He was poor, and the situation was tempting; yet
      it cannot but seem extraordinary that a man who had played a first part in
      politics, and whose abilities had been found not unequal to that part, who
      had sat in the Cabinet, who had led the House of Commons, who had been
      twice intrusted by the King with the office of forming a ministry, who was
      regarded as the rival of Pitt, and who at one time seemed likely to be a
      successful rival, should have consented, for the sake of emolument, to
      take a subordinate place, and to give silent votes for all the measures of
      a government to the deliberations of which he was not summoned. <span
      class="pagenum">244</span><a name="link244" id="link244"></a>The first
      acts of the new administration were characterized rather by vigour than by
      judgment. Expeditions were sent against different parts of the French
      coast with little success. The small island of Aix was taken, Rochefort
      threatened, a few ships burned in the harbour of St. Maloes, and a few
      guns and mortars brought home as trophies from the fortifications of
      Cherbourg. But soon conquest of a very different kind filled the kingdom
      with pride and rejoicing. A succession of victories undoubtedly brilliant,
      and, as it was thought, not barren, raised to the highest point the fame
      of the minister to whom the conduct of the war had been intrusted. In
      July, 1758, Louisburg fell. The whole island of Cape Breton was reduced.
      The fleet to which the Court of Versailles had confided the defence of
      French America was destroyed. The captured standards were borne in triumph
      from Kensington Palace to the city, and were suspended in St. Paul&rsquo;s
      Church, amidst the roar of guns and kettle-drums, and the shouts of an
      immense multitude. Addresses of congratulation came in from all the great
      towns of England. Parliament met only to decree thanks and monuments, and
      to bestow, without one murmur, supplies more than double of those which
      had been given during the war of the Grand Alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year 1759 opened with the conquest of Gorec. Next fell Guadaloupe;
      then Ticonderoga; then Niagara. The Toulon squadron was completely
      defeated by Boscawen off Cape Inigos. But the greatest exploit of the year
      was the achievement of Wolfe on the heights of Abraham. The news of his
      glorious death and of the fall of Quebec reached London in the very week
      in which the Houses met. All was joy and triumph. Envy and faction were
      forced to join in the <span class="pagenum">245</span><a name="link245"
       id="link245"></a>general applause. Whigs and Tories vied with each other
      in extolling the genius and energy of Pitt. His colleagues were never
      talked of or thought of. The House of Commons, the nation, the colonies,
      our allies, our enemies, had their eyes fixed on him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had Parliament voted a monument to Wolfe when another great event
      called for fresh rejoicings. The Brest fleet, under the command of
      Conflans, had put out to sea. It was overtaken by an English squadron
      under Hawke. Conflans attempted to take shelter close under the French
      coast. The shore was rocky: the night was black: the wind was furious: the
      waves of the Bay of Biscay ran high. But Pitt had infused into every
      branch of the service a spirit which had long been unknown. No British
      seaman was disposed to err on the same side with Byng. The pilot told
      Hawke that the attack could not be made without the greatest danger. &ldquo;You
      have done your duty in remonstrating,&rdquo; answered Hawke; &ldquo;I will answer for
      every thing. I command you to lay me alongside the French admiral.&rdquo; Two
      French ships of the line struck. Four were destroyed. The rest hid
      themselves in the rivers of Britanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year 1760 came; and still triumph followed triumph. Montreal was
      taken; the whole province of Canada was subjugated; the French fleets
      underwent a succession of disasters in the seas of Europe and America.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime conquests equalling in rapidity, and far surpassing in
      magnitude, those of Cortes and Pizarro, had been achieved in the East. In
      the space of three years the English had founded a mighty empire. The
      French had been defeated in every part of India. Chandernagore had
      surrendered to Clive, <span class="pagenum">246</span><a name="link246"
       id="link246"></a>Pondicherry to Coote. Throughout Bengal, Bahar. Orissa
      and the Carnatic, the authority of the East India Company was more
      absolute than that of Acbar or Aurungzebe had ever been.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the continent of Europe the odds were against England. We had but one
      important ally, the King of Prussia; and he was attacked, not only by
      France, but also by Russia and Austria. Yet even on the Continent, the
      energy of Pitt triumphed over all difficulties. Vehemently as he had
      condemned the practice of subsidising foreign princes, he now carried that
      practice farther than Carteret himself would have ventured to do. The
      active and able Sovereign of Prussia received such pecuniary assistance as
      enabled him to maintain the conflict on equal terms against his powerful
      enemies. On no subject had Pitt ever spoken with so much eloquence and
      ardour as on the mischiefs of the Hanoverian connection. He now declared,
      not without much show of reason, that it would be unworthy of the English
      people to suffer their King to be deprived of his electoral dominions in
      an English quarrel. He assured his countrymen that they should be no
      losers, and that he would conquer America for them in Germany. By taking
      this line he conciliated the King, and lost no part of his influence with
      the nation. In Parliament, such was the ascendency which his eloquence,
      his success, his high situation, his pride, and his intrepidity had
      obtained for him, that he took liberties with the House of which there had
      been no example, and which have never since been imitated. No orator could
      there venture to reproach him with inconsistency. One unfortunate man made
      the attempt, and was so much disconcerted by the scornful demeanour of the
      Minister that he stammered, stopped, and <span class="pagenum">247</span><a
      name="link247" id="link247"></a>sat down. Even the old Tory country
      gentlemen, to whom the very name of Hanover had been odious, gave their
      hearty Ayes to subsidy after subsidy. In a lively contemporary satire,
      much more lively indeed than delicate, this remarkable conversion is not
      unhappily described. <br /><br /><span class="indent25">"No more they make a
      fiddle-faddle <br /><span class="indent25">About a Hessian horse or saddle.
      <br /><span class="indent25">No more of continental measures; <br /><span
      class="indent25">No more of wasting British treasures. <br /><span
      class="indent25">Ten millions, and a vote of credit, <br /><span
      class="indent25">&rsquo;Tis right. He can&rsquo;t be wrong who did it.&rdquo; </span></span></span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of Pitt&rsquo;s continental measures was such as might have been
      expected from their vigour. When he came into power, Hanover was in
      imminent danger; and before he had been in office three months, the whole
      electorate was in the hands of France. But the face of affairs was
      speedily changed. The invaders were driven out. An army, partly English,
      partly Hanoverian, partly composed of soldiers furnished by the petty
      princes of Germany, was placed under the command of Prince Ferdinand of
      Brunswick. The French were beaten in 1758 at Crevelt. In 1759 they
      received a still more complete and humiliating defeat at Minden.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, the nation exhibited all the signs of wealth and
      prosperity. The merchants of London had never been more thriving. The
      importance of several great commercial and manufacturing towns, of Glasgow
      in particular, dates from this period. The fine inscription on the
      monument of Lord Chatham in Guildhall records the general opinion of the
      citizens of London, that under his administration commerce had been
      &ldquo;united with and made to flourish by war.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">248</span><a
      name="link248" id="link248"></a>It must be owned that these signs of
      prosperity were in some degree delusive. It must be owned that some of our
      conquests were rather splendid than useful. It must be owned that the
      expense of the war never entered into Pitt&rsquo;s consideration. Perhaps it
      would be more correct to say that the cost of his victories increased the
      pleasure with which he contemplated them. Unlike other men in his
      situation, he loved to exaggerate the sums which the nation was laying out
      under his direction. He was proud of the sacrifices and efforts which his
      eloquence and his success had induced his countrymen to make. The price at
      which he purchased faithful service and complete victory, though far
      smaller than that which his son, the most profuse and incapable of war
      ministers, paid for treachery, defeat, and shame, was long and severely
      felt by the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as a war minister, Pitt is scarcely entitled to all the praise which
      his contemporaries lavished on him. We, perhaps from ignorance, cannot
      discern in his arrangements any appearance of profound or dexterous
      combination. Several of his expeditions, particularly those which were
      sent to the coast of France, were at once costly and absurd. Our Indian
      conquests, though they add to the splendour of the period during which he
      was at the head of affairs, were not planned by him. He had undoubtedly
      great energy, great determination, great means at his command. His temper
      was enterprising; and, situated as he was, he had only to follow his
      temper. The wealth of a rich nation, the valour of a brave nation, were
      ready to support him in every attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one respect, however, he deserved all the praise that he has ever
      received. The success of our arms was perhaps owing less to the skill of
      his dispositions <span class="pagenum">240</span><a name="link240"
       id="link240_"></a>than to the national resources and the national spirit.
      But that the national spirit rose to the emergency, that the national
      resources were contributed with unexampled cheerfulness, this was
      undoubtedly his work. The ardour of his soul had set the whole kingdom on
      fire. It inflamed every soldier who dragged the cannon up the heights of
      Quebec, and every sailor who boarded the French ships among the rocks of
      Britanny. The Minister, before he had been long in office, had imparted to
      the commanders whom he employed his own impetuous, adventurous, and
      defying character. They, like him, were disposed to risk every thing, to
      play double or quits to the last, to think nothing done while any thing
      remained undone, to fail rather than not to attempt. For the errors of
      rashness there might be indulgence. For over-caution, for faults like
      those of Lord George Sackville, there was no mercy. In other times, and
      against other enemies, this mode of warfare might have failed. But the
      state of the French government and of the French nation gave every
      advantage to Pitt. The fops and intriguers of Versailles were appalled and
      bewildered by his vigour. A panic spread through all ranks of society. Our
      enemies soon considered it as a settled thing that they were always to be
      beaten. Thus victory begot victory; till, at last, wherever the forces of
      the two nations met, they met with disdainful confidence on one side, and
      with a craven fear on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation which Pitt occupied at the close of the reign of George the
      Second was the most enviable ever occupied by any public man in English
      history. He had conciliated the King; he domineered over the House of
      Commons; he was adored by the people; he was admired by all Europe. He was
      the first Englishman <span class="pagenum">250</span><a name="link250"
       id="link250"></a>of his time: and he had made England the first country in
      the world. The Great Commoner, the name by which he was often designated,
      might look down with scorn on coronets and garters. The nation was drunk
      with joy and pride. The Parliament was as quiet as it had been under
      Pelham. The old party distinctions were almost effaced; nor was their
      place yet supplied by distinctions of a still more important kind. A new
      generation of country squires and rectors had arisen who knew not the
      Stuarts. The Dissenters were tolerated; the Catholics not cruelly
      persecuted. The Church was drowsy and indulgent. The great civil and
      religious conflict which began at the Reformation seemed to have
      terminated in universal repose. Whigs and Tories, Churchmen and Puritans,
      spoke with equal reverence of the constitution, and with equal enthusiasm
      of the talents, virtues, and services of the Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few years sufficed to change the whole aspect of affairs. A nation
      convulsed by faction, a throne assailed by the fiercest invective, a House
      of Commons hated and despised by the nation, England set against Scotland,
      Britain set against America, a rival legislature sitting beyond the
      Atlantic, English blood shed by English bayonets, our armies capitulating,
      our conquests wrested from us, our enemies hastening to take vengeance for
      past humiliation, our flag scarcely able to maintain itself in our own
      seas, such was the spectacle which Pitt lived to see. But the history of
      this great revolution requires far more space than we can at present
      bestow. We leave the Great Commoner in the zenith of his glory. It is not
      impossible that we may take some other opportunity of tracing his life to
      its melancholly, yet not inglorious close.

     (1) <i>History of the Revolution in England, in 1688.
     Comprising a View of the Reign of James the Second, from his
     Accession to the Enterprise of the Prince, of Orange</i>, by
     the lute Right Honourable Sir James Mackintosh; <i>and
     completed to the Settlement of the Crown, by the Editor. To
     which is prefixed a Notice of the Life, Writings, and
     Speeches of Sir James Mackintosh</i>. 4to. London: 1834.*

     * In this review, as it originally stood, the editor of the
     History of the Revolution was attacked with an asperity
     which neither literary&rsquo; defects nor speculative differences
     can justify, and which ought to be reserved for offences
     against the laws of morality and honour The reviewer was not
     actuated by any feeling of personal&rsquo; malevolence: for when
     he wrote this paper in a distant country, he did not know,
     or even guess, whom he was assailing. His only motive was
     regard for the memory of an eminent man whom he loved and
     honoured, and who appeared to him to have been unworthily
     treated.

     The editor is now dead; and, while living, declared that he
     had been misunderstood, and that he had written in no spirit
     of enmity to Sir James Mackintosh, for whom he professed the
     highest respect.

     Many passages have therefore been softened, and some wholly
     omitted. The severe censure passed on the literary execution
     of the Memoir and the Continuation could not be retracted
     without a violation of truth. But whatever could be
     construed into an imputation on the moral character of the
     editor has been carefully expunged.

      <span class="pagenum">252</span><a name="link252" id="link252"></a>wisdom
      are in our ears. We will attempt to preserve strict impartiality. But we
      are not ashamed to own that we approach this relic of a virtuous and most
      accomplished man with feelings of respect and gratitude which may possibly
      pervert our judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hardly possible to avoid instituting a comparison between this work
      and another celebrated Fragment. Our readers will easily guess that we
      allude to Mr. Fox&rsquo;s History of James the Second The two books relate to
      the same subject. Both were posthumously published. Neither had received
      the last corrections. The authors belonged to the same political party,
      and held the same opinions concerning the merits and defects of the
      English constitution, and concerning most of the prominent characters and
      events in English history. Both had thought much on the principles of
      government; yet they were not mere speculators. Both had ransacked the
      archives of rival kingdoms, and pored on folios which had mouldered for
      ages in deserted libraries; yet they were not mere antiquaries. They had
      one eminent qualification for writing history: they had spoken history,
      acted history, lived history. The turns of political fortune, the ebb and
      flow of popular feeling, the hidden mechanism by which parties are moved,
      all these things were the subjects of their constant thought and of their
      most familiar conversation. Gibbon has remarked that he owed part of his
      success as a historian to the observations which he had made as an officer
      in the militia and as a member of the House of Commons. The remark is most
      just. We have not the smallest doubt that his campaign, though he never
      saw an enemy, and his parliamentary attendance, though he never made a
      speech, were of far <span class="pagenum">253</span><a name="link253"
       id="link253"></a>more use to him than years of retirement and study would
      have been. If the time that he spent on parade and at mess in Hampshire,
      or on the Treasury bench and at Brookes&rsquo;s during the storms which
      overthrew Lord North and Lord Shelburne, had been passed in the Bodleian
      Library, he might have avoided some inaccuracies; he might have enriched
      his notes with a greater number of references; but he would never have
      produced so lively a picture of the court, the camp, and the senate-house.
      In this respect Mr. Fox and Sir James Mackintosh had great advantages over
      almost every English historian who has written since the time of Burnet.
      Lord Lyttelton had indeed the same advantages; but he was incapable of
      using them. Pedantry was so deeply fixed in his nature that the hustings,
      the Treasury, the Exchequer, the House of Commons, the House of Lords,
      left him the same dreaming schoolboy that they found him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we compare the two interesting works of which we have been speaking,
      we have little difficulty in giving the preference to that of Sir James
      Mackintosh. Indeed the superiority of Mr. Fox to Sir Janies as an orator
      is hardly more clear than the superiority of Sir James to Mr. Fox as an
      historian. Mr. Fox with a pen in his hand, and Sir James on his legs in
      the House of Commons, were, we think, each out of his proper element. They
      were men, it is true, of far too much judgment and ability to fail
      scandalously in any undertaking to which they brought the whole power of
      their minds. The history of James the Second will always keep its place in
      our libraries as a valuable book; and Sir James Mackintosh succeeded in
      winning and maintaining a high place among the parliamentary speakers of
      his time. Yet we could <span class="pagenum">254</span><a name="link254"
       id="link254"></a>never read a page of Mr. Fox&rsquo;s writing, we could never
      listen for a quarter of an hour to the speaking of Sir James, without
      feeling that there was a constant effort, a tug up hill. Nature, or habit
      which had become nature, asserted its rights. Mr. Fox wrote debates. Sir
      James Mackintosh spoke essays.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as mere diction was concerned, indeed, Mr. Fox did his best to
      avoid those faults which the habit of public speaking is likely to
      generate. He was so nervously apprehensive of sliding into some colloquial
      incorrectness, of debasing his style by a mixture of parliamentary slang,
      that he ran into the opposite error, and purified his vocabulary with a
      scrupulosity unknown to any purist. &ldquo;Ciceronem Allobroga dixit.&rdquo; He would
      not allow Addison, Bolingbroke, or Middleton to be a sufficient authority
      for an expression. He declared that he would use no word which was not to
      be found in Dryden. In any other person we should have called this
      solicitude mere foppery; and, in spite of all our admiration for Mr. Fox,
      we cannot but think that his extreme attention to the petty niceties of
      language was hardly worthy of so manly and so capacious an understanding.
      There were purists of this kind at Home; and their fastidiousness was
      censured by Horace, with that perfect good sense and good taste which
      characterize all his writings. There were purists of this kind at the time
      of the revival of letters; and the two greatest scholars of that time
      raised their voices, the one from within, the other from without the Alps,
      against a scrupulosity so unreasonable. &ldquo;Carent,&rdquo; said Politian, &ldquo;quæ
      scribunt isti viribus et vita, carent actu, carent effectu, carent
      indole....Nisi liber ille præsto sit ex quo quid excerpant, colligere tria
      verba non possunt....Horum semper igitur oratio Iremula, vacillans. <span
      class="pagenum">255</span><a name="link255" id="link255"></a>infirma....Quæso
      ne ista superstitione te alliges....Ut bene currere non potest qui pedem
      ponere studet in alienis tantum vestigiis, ita nec bene scribere qui
      tanquam de præscripto non audet egredi.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Postliac,&rdquo; exclaims
      Erasmus, &ldquo;non licebit episcopos appellare patres reverendos, nec in calce
      literarum scribere annum a Christo nato, quod id nusquam facial Cicero.
      Quid autem ineptius quam, toto seculo novato, religione, imperiis,
      magistratibus, locorum vocabulis, ædificiis, cultu, monbus, non aliter
      andere loqui quam locutus est Cicero? Si revivisceret ipse Cicero, rideret
      hoc Ciceronianorum genus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Mr. Fox winnowed and sifted his phraseology with a care which seems
      hardly consistent with the simplicity and elevation of his mind, and of
      which the effect really was to debase and enfeeble his style, he was
      little on his guard against those more serious improprieties of manner
      into which a great orator who undertakes to write history is in danger of
      falling. There is about the whole book a vehement, contentious, replying
      manner. Almost every argument is put in the form of an interrogation, an
      ejaculation, or a sarcasm. The writer seems to be addressing himself to
      some imaginary audience, to be tearing in pieces a defence of the Stuarts
      which has just been pronounced by an imaginary Tory. Take, for example,
      his answer to Hume&rsquo;s remarks on the execution of Sydney; and substitute
      &ldquo;the honourable gentleman&rdquo; or &ldquo;the noble Lord&rdquo; for the name of Hume. The
      whole passage sounds like a powerful reply, thundered at three in the
      morning from the Opposition Bench. While we read it, we can almost fancy
      that we see and hear the great English debater, such as he has been
      described to us by the few who can still remember the Westminster scrutiny
      and the <span class="pagenum">256</span><a name="link256" id="link256"></a>Oczakow
      Negotiations, in the full paroxysm of inspiration, foaming, screaming,
      choked by the rushing multitude of his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that the passage to which we have referred, and several other
      passages which we could point out, are admirable when considered merely as
      exhibitions of mental power. We at once recognise in them that consummate
      master of the whole art of intellectual gladiatorship, whose speeches,
      imperfectly as they have been transmitted to us, should be studied day and
      night by every man who wishes to learn the science of logical defence. We
      find in several parts of the History of James the Second fine specimens of
      that which we conceive to have been the great characteristic of
      Demosthenes among the Greeks, and of Fox among the orators of England,
      reason penetrated, and, if we may venture on the expression, made red-hot
      by passion. But this is not the kind of excellence proper to history; and
      it is hardly too much to say that whatever is strikingly good in Mr. Fox&rsquo;s
      fragment is out of place.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Sir James Mackintosh the case was reversed. His proper place was his
      library, a circle of men of letters, or a chair of moral and political
      philosophy. He distinguished himself highly in Parliament. But
      nevertheless Parliament was not exactly the sphere for him. The effect of
      his most successful speeches was small when compared with the quantity of
      ability and learning which was expended on them. We could easily name men
      who, not possessing a tenth part of his intellectual powers, hardly ever
      address the House of Commons without producing a greater impression than
      was produced by his most splendid and elaborate orations. His luminous and
      philosophical disquisition on the Reform Bill was spoken to empty benches.
      <span class="pagenum">257</span><a name="link257" id="link257"></a>Those,
      indeed, who had the wit to keep their seats, picked up hints which,
      skilfully used, made the fortune of more than one speech. But &ldquo;it was
      caviare to the general.&rdquo; And even those who listened to Sir James with
      pleasure and admiration could not but acknowledge that he rather lectured
      than debated. An artist who should waste on a panorama, or a scene, or on
      a transparency, the exquisite finishing which we admire in some of the
      small Dutch interiors, would not squander his powers more than this
      eminent man too often did. His audience resembled the boy in the Heart of
      Mid-Lothian, who pushes away the lady&rsquo;s guineas with contempt, and insists
      on having the white money. They preferred the silver with which they were
      familiar, and which they were constantly passing about from hand to hand,
      to the gold which they had never before seen, and with the value of which
      they were unacquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is much to be regretted, we think, that Sir James Mackintosh did not
      wholly devote his later years to philosophy and literature. His talents
      were not those which enable a speaker to produce with rapidity a series of
      striking but transitory impressions, and to excite the minds of five
      hundred gentlemen at midnight, without saying any thing that any one of
      them will be able to remember in the morning. His arguments were of a very
      different texture from those which are produced in Parliament at a
      moment&rsquo;s notice, which puzzle a plain man who, if he had them before him
      in writing, would soon detect their fallacy, and which the great debater
      who employs them forgets within half an hour, and never thinks of again.
      Whatever was valuable in the compositions of Sir James Mackintosh was the
      ripe fruit of study and of <span class="pagenum">258</span><a
      name="link258" id="link258"></a>meditation. It was the same with his
      conversation. In his most familiar talk there was no wildness, no
      inconsistency, no amusing nonsense, no exaggeration for the sake of
      momentary effect. His mind was a vast magazine, admirably arranged. Every
      thing was there; and every thing was in its place. His judgments on men,
      on sects, on books, had been often and carefully tested and weighed, and
      had then been committed, each to his proper receptacle, in the most
      capacious and accurately constructed memory that any human being ever
      possessed. It would have been strange indeed if you had asked for any
      thing that was not to be found in that immense storehouse. The article
      which you required was not only there. It was ready. It was in its own
      proper compartment.. In a moment it was brought down, unpacked, and
      displayed. If those who enjoyed the privilege&mdash;for a privilege indeed
      it was&mdash;of listening to Sir Janies Mackintosh, had been disposed to
      find some fault in his conversation, they might perhaps have observed that
      he yielded too little to the impulse of the moment. He seemed to be
      recollecting, not creating. He never appeared to catch a sudden glimpse of
      a subject in a new light. You never saw his opinions in the making, still
      rude, still inconsistent, and requiring to be fashioned by thought and
      discussion. They came forth, like the pillars of that temple in which no
      sound of axes or hammers was heard, finished, rounded, and exactly suited
      to their places. What Mr. Charles Lamb has said with so much humour and
      some truth, of the conversation of Scotchmen in general, was certainly
      true of this eminent Scotchman. He did not find, but bring. You could not
      cry halves to any thing that turned up while you were in his company.
      <span class="pagenum">259</span><a name="link259" id="link259"></a>The
      intellectual and moral qualities which are most important in a historian,
      he possessed in a very high degree. He was singularly mild, calm, and
      impartial in his judgments of men, and of parties. Almost all the
      distinguished writers who have treated of English history are advocates.
      Mr. Hallam and Sir James Mackintosh alone are entitled to be called
      judges. But the extreme austerity of Mr. Hallam takes away something from
      the pleasure of reading his learned, eloquent, and judicious writings. He
      is a judge, but a hanging judge, the Page or Buller of the High Court of
      Literary Justice. His black cap is in constant requisition. In the long
      calendar of those whom he has tried, there is hardly one who has not, in
      spite of evidence to character and recommendations to mercy, been
      sentenced and left for execution. Sir James, perhaps, erred a little on
      the other side. He liked a maiden assize, and came away with white gloves,
      after sitting in judgment on batches of the most notorious offenders. He
      had a quick eye for the redeeming parts of a character, and a large
      toleration for the infirmities of men exposed to strong temptations. But
      this lenity did not arise from ignorance or neglect of moral distinctions.
      Though he allowed perhaps too much weight to every extenuating
      circumstance that could be urged in favour of the transgressor, he never
      disputed the authority of the law, or showed his ingenuity by refining
      away its enactments. On every occasion he showed himself firm where
      principles were in question, but full of charity towards individuals.

      We have no hesitation in pronouncing this Fragment decidedly the best
      history now extant of the reign of James the Second. It contains much new
      and curious information, of which excellent use has <span class="pagenum">260</span><a
      name="link260" id="link260"></a>been made. But we are not sure that the
      book is not in some degree open to the charge which the idle citizen in
      the Spectator brought against his pudding; &ldquo;Mem. too many plums, and no
      suet.&rdquo; There is perhaps too much disquisition and too little narrative;
      and indeed this is the fault into which, judging from the habits of Sir
      James&rsquo;s mind, we should have thought him most likely to fall. What we
      assuredly did not anticipate was, that the narrative would be better
      executed than the disquisitions. We expected to find, and we have found,
      many just delineations of character, and many digressions full of
      interest, such as the account of the order of Jesuits, and of the state of
      prison discipline in England a hundred and fifty years ago. We expected to
      find, and we have found, many reflections breathing the spirit of a calm
      and benignant philosophy. But we did not, we own, expect to find that Sir
      James could tell a story as well as Voltaire or Hume. Yet such is the
      fact; and if any person doubts it, we would advise him to read the account
      of the events which followed the issuing of King James&rsquo;s declaration, the
      meeting of the clergy, the violent scene at the privy council, the
      commitment, trial, and acquittal of the bishops. The most superficial
      reader must be charmed, we think, by the liveliness of the narrative. But
      no person who is not acquainted with that vast mass of intractable
      materials of which the valuable and interesting part has been extracted
      and condensed can fully appreciate the skill of the writer. Here, and
      indeed throughout the book, we find many harsh and careless expressions
      which the author would probably have removed if he had lived to complete
      his work. But, in spite of these blemishes, we must say that we should
      find it difficult to point out, <span class="pagenum">261</span><a
      name="link261" id="link261"></a>in any modern history, any passage of
      equal length and at the same time of equal merit. We find in it the
      diligence, the accuracy, and the judgment of Hallam, united to the
      vivacity and the colouring of Southey. A history of England, written
      throughout in this manner, would be the most fascinating book in the
      language. It would be more in request at the circulating libraries than
      the last novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James was not, we think, gifted with poetical imagination. But that
      lower kind of imagination which is necessary to the historian he had in
      large measure. It is not the business of the historian to create new
      worlds and to people them with new races of beings. He is to Homer and
      Shakspeare, to Dante and Milton, what Nollekens was to Canova, or Lawrence
      to Michael Angelo. The object of the historian&rsquo;s imitation is not within
      him; it is furnished from without. It is not a vision of beauty and
      grandeur discernible only by the eye of his own mind, but a real model
      which he did not make, and which he cannot alter. Yet his is not a mere
      mechanical imitation. The triumph of his skill is to select such parts as
      may produce the effect of the whole, to bring out strongly all the
      characteristic features, and to throw the light and shade in such a manner
      as may heighten the effect. This skill, as far as we can judge, from the
      unfinished work now before us, Sir James Mackintosh possessed in an
      eminent degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The style of this Fragment is weighty, manly, and unaffected. There are,
      as we have said, some expressions which seem to us harsh, and some which
      we think inaccurate. These would probably have been corrected, if Sir
      James had lived to superintend the publication. We ought to add that the
      printer has by no <span class="pagenum">262</span><a name="link262"
       id="link262"></a>means done his duty. One misprint, in particular, is so
      serious as to require notice. Sir James Mackintosh has paid a high and
      just tribute to the genius, the integrity, and the courage of a good and
      great man, a distinguished ornament of English literature, a fearless
      champion of English liberty, Thomas Burnet, Master of the Charter-House,
      and author of that most eloquent and imaginative work, the <i>Tellaris
      Theoria Sacra</i>. Wherever the name of this celebrated man occurs, it is
      printed &ldquo;Bennet,&rdquo; both in the text and in the index. This cannot be mere
      negligence. It is plain that Thomas Burnet and his writings were never
      heard of by the gentleman who has been employed to edite this volume, and
      who, not content with deforming Sir James Mackintosh&rsquo;s text by such
      blunders, has prefixed to it a bad Memoir, has appended to it a bad
      Continuation, and has thus succeeded in expanding the volume into one of
      the thickest, and debasing it into one of the worst that we ever saw.
      Never did we fall in with so admirable an illustration of the old Greek
      proverb, which tells us that half is sometimes more than the whole. Never,
      did we see a case in which the increase of the bulk was so evidently a
      diminution of the value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why such an artist was selected to deface so fine a Torso, we cannot
      pretend to conjecture. We read that, when the Consul Mummius, after the
      taking of Corinth, was preparing to send to Rome some works of the
      greatest Grecian sculptors, he told the packers that if they broke his
      Venus or his Apollo, he would force them to restore the limbs which should
      be wanting. A head by a hewer of mile-stones joined to a bosom by
      Praxiteles would not surprise or shock us more than this supplement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Memoir contains much that is worth reading; <span class="pagenum">263</span><a
      name="link263" id="link263"></a>for it contains many extracts from the
      compositions of Sir James Mackintosh. But when we pass from what the
      biographer has done with his scissors to what he has done with his pen, we
      can find nothing to praise in his work. Whatever may have been the
      intention with which he wrote, the tendency of his narrative is to convey
      the impression that Sir James Mackintosh, from interested motives,
      abandoned the doctrines of the <i>Vindicice Grallicae</i>. Had such
      charges appeared in their natural place, we should leave them to their
      natural fate. We would not stoop to defend Sir James Mackintosh from the
      attacks of fourth-rate magazines and pothouse newspapers. But here his own
      fame is turned against him. A book of which not one copy would ever have
      been bought but for his name in the title page is made the vehicle of the
      imputation. Under such circumstances we cannot help exclaiming, in the
      words of one of the most amiable of Homer&rsquo;s heroes,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0002" id="linkimage-0002"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>

    <p>
      We have no difficulty in admitting that, during the ten or twelve years
      which followed the appearance of the <i>Vindicio Gallicae</i>, the
      opinions of Sir James Mackintosh underwent some change. But did this
      chancre pass on him alone? Was it not common? Was it not almost universal?
      Was there one honest friend of liberty in Europe or in America whose
      ardour had not been damped, whose faith in the high destinies of mankind
      had not been shaken? Was there one observer to whom the French Revolution,
      or revolutions in general, appeared in exactly the same light on the day
      when the Bastile fell, and on the day when the Girondists were dragged to
      the scaffold, the day when the Directory <span class="pagenum">264</span><a
      name="link264" id="link264"></a>shipped off their principal opponents for
      Guiana, or the day when the Legislative Body was driven from its hall at
      the point of the bayonet? We do not speak of light-minded and enthusiastic
      people, of wits like Sheridan, or poets like Alfieri; but of the most
      virtuous and intelligent practical statesmen, and of the deepest, the
      calmest, the most impartial political speculators of that time. What was
      the language and conduct of Lord Spencer, of Lord Fitzwilliam, of Mr.
      Grattan? What is the tone of M. Dumont&rsquo;s Memoirs, written just at the
      close of the eighteenth century? What Tory could have spoken with greater
      disgust and contempt of the French Revolution and its authors? Nay, this
      writer, a republican, and the most upright and zealous of republicans, has
      gone so far as to say that Mr. Burke&rsquo;s work on the Revolution had saved
      Europe. The name of M. Dumont naturally suggests that of Mr. Bentham. He,
      we presume, was not ratting for a place; and what language did he hold at
      that time? Look at his little treatise entitled <i>Sophismes Anarchiques</i>.
      In that treatise he says, that the atrocities of the Revolution were the
      natural consequences of the absurd principles on which it was commenced;
      that, while the chiefs of the constituent assembly gloried in the thought
      that they were pulling down aristocracy, they never saw that their
      doctrines tended to produce an evil a hundred times more formidable,
      anarchy; that the theory laid down in the Declaration of the Rights of Man
      had, in a great measure, produced the crimes of the Reign of &lsquo;Terror; that
      none but an eyewitness could imagine the horrors of a state of society in
      which comments on that Declaration were put forth by men with no food in
      their bellies, with rags on their backs, and pikes in their hands. He
      praises the English Parliament for the dislike <span class="pagenum">265</span><a
      name="link265" id="link265"></a>which it has always shown to abstract
      reasonings, and to the affirming of general principles. In M. Dumont&rsquo;s
      preface to the Treatise on the Principles of Legislation, a preface
      written under the eye of Mr. Bentham, and published with his sanction, are
      the following still more remarkable expressions: &ldquo;M. Bentham est bien loin
      d&rsquo;attacher une. préférence exclusive à aucune forme de gouvernement. Il
      pense que la meilleure constitution pour un peuple est celle à laquelle il
      est accoutumé....Le vice fondamental des théories sur les constitutions
      politiques, c&rsquo;est de commencer par attaquer celles qui existent, et
      d&rsquo;exciter tout au moins des inquiétudes et des jalousies de pouvoir. Une
      telle disposition n&rsquo;est point favorable au perfectionnement des lois. La
      seule époque où l&rsquo;on puisse entreprendre avec succès des grandes réformes
      de législation, est celle où les passions publiques sont calmes, et où le
      gouvernement jouit de la stabilité la plus grande. L&rsquo;objet de M. Bentham,
      en cherchant dans le vice des lois la cause de la plupart des maux, a été
      constamment d&rsquo;éloigner le pins grand de tous, le bouleversement de
      l&rsquo;autorité, les révolutions de propriété et de pouvoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To so conservative a frame of mind had the excesses of the French
      Revolution brought the most illustrious reformers of that time. And why is
      one person to be singled out from among millions, and arraigned before
      posterity as a traitor to his opinions, only because events produced on
      him the effect which they produced on a whole generation? People who, like
      Mr. Brothers in the last generation, and Mr. Percival in this, have been
      favoured with revelations from heaven, may be quite independent of the
      vulgar sources of knowledge. But such poor creatures as Mackintosh,
      Dumont, and Bentham, <span class="pagenum">266</span><a name="link266"
       id="link266"></a>had nothing but observation and reason to guide them; and
      they obeyed the guidance of observation and of reason. How is it in
      physics? A traveller falls in with a berry which he has never before seen.
      He tastes it, and finds it sweet and refreshing. He praises it, and
      resolves to introduce it into his own country. But in a few minutes he is
      taken violently sick; he is convulsed; he is at the point of death. He of
      course changes his opinion, pronounces this delicious food a poison,
      blames his own folly in tasting it, and cautions his friends against it.
      After a long and violent struggle he recovers, and finds himself much
      exhausted by his sufferings, but free from some chronic complaints which
      had been the torment of his life. He then changes his opinion again, and
      pronounces this fruit a very powerful remedy, which ought to be employed
      only in extreme cases and with great caution, but which ought not to be
      absolutely excluded from the Pharmacopoeia. And would it not be the height
      of absurdity to call such a man fickle and inconsistent, because he had
      repeatedly altered his judgment? If he had not altered his judgment, would
      he have been a rational being? It was exactly the same with the French
      Revolution. That event was a new phænomenon in politics. Nothing that had
      gone before enabled any person to judge with certainty of the course which
      affairs might take. At first the effect was the reform of great abuses;
      and honest men rejoiced. Then came commotion, proscription, confiscation,
      bankruptcy, the assignats, the maximum, civil war, foreign war,
      revolutionary tribunals, guillotinades, noyades, fusillades. Yet a little
      while, and a military despotism rose out of the confusion, and menaced the
      independence of every state in Europe. And yet again a little while, and
      <span class="pagenum">267</span><a name="link267" id="link267"></a>the old
      dynasty returned, followed by a train of emigrants eager to restore the
      old abuses. We have now, we think, the whole before us. We should
      therefore be justly accused of levity or insincerity if our language
      concerning those events were constantly changing. It is our deliberate
      opinion that the French Revolution, in spite of all its crimes and
      follies, was a great blessing to mankind. But it was not only natural, but
      inevitable, that those who had only seen the first act should be ignorant
      of the catastrophe, and should be alternately elated and depressed as the
      plot went on disclosing itself to them. A man who had held exactly the
      same opinion about the Revolution in 1789, in 1794, in 1804, in 1814, and
      in 1884, would have been either a divinely inspired prophet, or an
      obstinate fool. Mackintosh was neither. He was simply a wise and good man;
      and the change which passed on his mind was a change which passed on the
      mind of almost every wise and good man in Europe. In fact, few of his
      contemporaries changed so little. The rare moderation and calmness of his
      temper preserved him alike from extravagant elation and from extravagant
      despondency. He was never a Jacobin. He was never an Antijacobin. His mind
      oscillated undoubtedly; but the extreme points of the oscillation were not
      very remote. Herein he differed greatly from some persons of distinguished
      talents who entered into life at nearly the same time with him. Such
      persons we have seen rushing from one wild extreme to another, out-Paining
      Paine, out-Castlereaghing Castlereagh, Pantisocratists, Ultra-Tories,
      heretics, persecutors, breaking the old laws against sedition, calling for
      new and sharper laws against sedition, writing democratic dramas, writing
      Laureate odes, panegyrising <span class="pagenum">268</span><a
      name="link268" id="link268"></a>Marten, panegyrising Land, consistent in
      nothing but an intolerance which in any person would be censurable, but
      which is altogether unpardonable in men who, by their own confession, have
      had such ample experience of their own fallibility. We readily concede to
      some of these persons the praise of eloquence and poetical invention; nor
      are we by any means disposed, even where they have been gainers by their
      conversion, to question their sincerity. It would be most uncandid to
      attribute to sordid motives actions which admit of a less discreditable
      explanation. We think that the conduct of these persons has been precisely
      what was to be expected from men who were gifted with strong imagination
      and quick sensibility, but who were neither accurate observers nor logical
      reasoners. It was natural that such men should see in the victory of the
      third estate of France the dawn of a new Saturnian age. It was natural
      that the rage of their disappointment should be proportioned to the
      extravagance of their hopes. Though the direction of their passions was
      altered, the violence of those passions was the same. The force of the
      rebound was proportioned to the force of the original impulse. The
      pendulum swung furiously to the left, because it had been drawn too far to
      the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      We own that nothing gives us so high an idea of the judgment and temper of
      Sir James Mackintosh as the manner in which he shaped his course through
      those times. Exposed successively to two opposite infections, he took both
      in their very mildest form. Hie constitution of his mind was such that
      neither of the diseases which wrought such havoc all round him could in
      any serious degree, or for any great length of time, derange his
      intellectual health. He, <span class="pagenum">269</span><a name="link269"
       id="link269"></a>like every honest and enlightened man in Europe, saw with
      delight the great awakening; of the French nation. Yet he never, in the
      season of his wannest enthusiasm, proclaimed doctrines inconsistent with
      the safety of property and the just authority of governments. He, like
      almost every other honest and enlightened man, was discouraged and
      perplexed by the terrible events which followed. Yet he never in the most
      gloomy times abandoned the cause of peace, of liberty, and of toleration.
      In that great convulsion which overset almost every other understanding,
      he was indeed so much shaken that he leaned sometimes in one direction and
      sometimes in the other; but he never lost his balance. The opinions in
      which he at last reposed, and to which, in spite of strong temptations, he
      adhered with a firm, a disinterested, an ill-requited fidelity, were a
      just mean between those which he had defended with youthful ardour and
      with more than manly prowess against Mr. Burke, and those to which he had
      inclined during the darkest and saddest years in the history of modern
      Europe. We are much mistaken if this be the picture either of a weak or of
      a dishonest mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the political opinions of Sir James Mackintosh were in his later
      years is written in the annals of his country. Those annals will
      sufficiently refute what the Editor has ventured to assert in the very
      advertisement to this work. &ldquo;Sir James Mackintosh,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;was avowedly
      and emphatically a Whig of the Revolution: and since the agitation of
      religious liberty and parliamentary reform became a national movement, the
      great transaction of 1688 has been more dispassionately, more correctly,
      and less highly estimated.&rdquo; If these words mean any thing, they must <span
      class="pagenum">270</span><a name="link270" id="link270"></a>mean that the
      opinions of Sir James Mackintosh concerning religious liberty and
      parliamentary reform went no further than those of the authors of the
      Revolution; in other words, that Sir James Mackintosh opposed Catholic
      Emancipation, and approved of the old constitution of the House of
      Commons. The allocation is confuted by twenty volumes of Parliamentary
      Debates, nay by innumerable passages in the very Fragment which this
      writer has defaced. We will venture to say that Sir James Mackintosh often
      did more for religions liberty and for parliamentary reform in a quarter
      of an hour, than most of those zealots who are in the habit of
      depreciating him, have done or will do in the whole course of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in the Memoir, or in the Continuation of the History, has struck
      us so much as the contempt with which the writer thinks fit to speak of
      all things that were done before the coming in of the very last fashions
      in politics. We think that we have sometimes observed a leaning towards
      the same fault in writers of a much higher order of intellect. We will
      therefore take this opportunity of making a few remarks on an error which
      is, we fear, becoming common, and which appears to us not only absurd, but
      as pernicious as almost any error concerning the transactions of a past
      age can possibly be.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall not, we hope, be suspected of a bigoted attachment to the
      doctrines and practices of past generations. Our creed is that the science
      of government is an experimental science, and that, like all other
      experimental sciences, it is generally in a state of progression. No man
      is so obstinate an admirer of the old times as to deny that medicine,
      surgery, botany, chemistry, engineering, navigation, are better understood
      <span class="pagenum">271</span><a name="link271" id="link271"></a>now
      than in any former age. We conceive that it is the same with political
      science. Like those physical sciences which we have mentioned, it has
      always been working itself clearer and clearer, and depositing impurity
      after impurity. There was a time when the most powerful of human
      intellects were deluded by the gibberish of the astrologer and the
      alchemist; and just so there was a time when the most enlightened and
      virtuous statesmen thought it the first duty of a government to persecute
      heretics, to found monasteries, to make war on Saracens. But time
      advances; facts accumulate; doubts arise. Faint glimpses of truth begin to
      appear, and shine more and more unto the perfect day. The highest
      intellects, like the tops of mountains, are the first to catch and to
      reflect the dawn. They are bright, while the level below is still in
      darkness. But soon the light, which at first illuminated only the loftiest
      eminences, descends on the plain and penetrates to the deepest valley.
      First come hints, then fragments of systems, then defective systems, then
      complete and harmonious systems. The sound opinion, held for a time by one
      bold speculator, becomes the opinion of a small minority, of a strong
      minority, of a majority of mankind. Thus, the great progress goes on, till
      schoolboys laugh at the jargon which imposed on Bacon, till country
      rectors condemn the illiberality and intolerance of Sir Thomas More.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing these things, seeing that, by the confession of the most obstinate
      enemies of innovation, our race has hitherto been almost constantly
      advancing in knowledge, and not seeing any reason to believe that,
      precisely at the point of time at which we came into the world, a change
      took place in the faculties of the human mind, or in the mode of
      discovering truth, we <span class="pagenum">272</span><a name="link272"
       id="link272"></a>are reformers: we are on the side of progress. From the
      great advances which European society lias made, during the last four
      centuries, in every species of knowledge, we infer, not that there is no
      more room for improvement, but that, in every science which deserves the
      name, immense improvements may be confidently expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the very considerations which lead us to look for ward with sanguine
      hope to the future prevent us from looking back with contempt on the past.
      We do not flatter ourselves with the notion that we have attained
      perfection, and that no more truth remains to be found. We believe that we
      are wiser than our ancestors. We believe, also, that our posterity will be
      wiser than we. It would be gross injustice in our grandchildren to talk of
      us with contempt, merely because they may have surpassed us; to call Watt
      a fool, because mechanical powers may be discovered which may supersede
      the use of steam; to deride the efforts which have been made in our time
      to improve the discipline of prisons, and to enlighten the minds of the
      poor, because future philanthropists may devise better places of
      confinement than Air. Bentham&rsquo;s Panopticon, and better places of education
      than Air. Lancaster&rsquo;s Schools. As we would have our descendants judge us,
      so ought we to judge our fathers. In order to form a correct estimate of
      their merits, we ought to place ourselves in their situation, to put out
      of our minds, for a time, all that knowledge which they, however eager in
      the pursuit of truth, could not have, and which we, however negligent we
      may have been, could not help having. It was not merely difficult, but
      absolutely impossible, for the best and greatest of men, two hundred years
      ago, to be what a very commonplace person <span class="pagenum">273</span><a
      name="link273" id="link273"></a>in our days may easily be, and indeed must
      necessarily be. But it is too much that the benefactors of mankind, after
      having been reviled by the dunces of their own generation for going too
      far, should be reviled by the dunces of the next generation for not going
      far enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth lies between two absurd extremes. On one side is the bigot who
      pleads the wisdom of our ancestors as a reason for not doing what they in
      our place would be the first to do; who opposes the Reform Bill because
      Lord Somers did not see the necessity of Parliamentary Reform; who would
      have opposed the Revolution because Ridley and Cranmer professed boundless
      submission to the royal prerogative; and who would have opposed the
      Reformation because the Fitzwalters and Mareschals, whose seals are set to
      the Great Charter, were devoted adherents to the Church of Rome. On the
      other side is the sciolist who speaks with scorn of the Great Charter,
      because it did not reform the Church; of the Reformation, because it did
      not limit the prerogative; and of the Revolution, because it did not
      purify the House of Commons. The former of these errors we have often
      combated, and shall always be ready to combat. The latter, though rapidly
      spreading, has not, we think, yet come under our notice. The former error
      bears directly on practical questions, and obstructs useful reforms. It
      may, therefore, seem to be, and probably is, the more mischievous of the
      two. But the latter is equally absurd; it is at least equally symptomatic
      of a shallow understanding; and an unamiable temper: and, if it should
      ever become general, it will, we are satisfied, produce very prejudicial
      effects. Its tendency is to deprive the benefactors of mankind of <span
      class="pagenum">274</span><a name="link274" id="link274"></a>their honest
      fame, and to put the best and the worst men of past times on the same
      level. The author of a great reformation is almost always unpopular in his
      own age. He generally passes his life in disquiet and danger. It is
      therefore for the interest of the human race that the memory of such men
      should be had in reverence, and that they should be supported against the
      scorn and hatred of their contemporaries by the hope of leaving a great
      and imperishable name. To go on the forlorn hope of truth is a service of
      peril. Who will undertake it, if it be not also a service of honour? It is
      easy enough, after the ramparts are carried, to find men to plant the flag
      on the highest tower. The difficulty is to find men who are ready to go
      first into the breach; and it would be bad policy indeed to insult their
      remains because they fell in the breach, and did not live to penetrate to
      the citadel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now here we have a book which is by no means a favourable specimen of the
      English literature of the nineteenth century, a book indicating neither
      extensive knowledge nor great powers of reasoning. And, if we were to
      judge by the pity with which the writer speaks of the great statesmen and
      philosophers of a former age, we should guess that he was the author of
      the most original and important inventions in political science. Yet not
      so: for men who are able to make discoveries are generally disposed to
      make allowances. Men who are eagerly pressing forward in pursuit of truth
      are grateful to every one who has cleared an inch of the way for them. It
      is, for the most part, the man who has just capacity enough to pick up and
      repeat the commonplaces which are fashionable in his own time who looks
      with disdain on the very intellects to which it is owing that those <span
      class="pagenum">275</span><a name="link275" id="link275"></a>commonplaces
      are not still considered as startling paradoxes or damnable heresies. This
      writer is just the man who, if he had lived in the seventeenth century,
      would have devoutly believed that the Papists burned London, who would
      have swallowed the whole of Oates&rsquo;s story about the forty thousand
      soldiers, disguised as pilgrims, who were to meet in Gallicia, and sail
      thence to invade England, who would have carried a Protestant flail under
      his coat, and who would have been angry if the story of the warmingpan had
      been questioned. It is quite natural that such a man should speak with
      contempt of the great reformers of that time, because they did not know
      some things which he never would have known but for the salutary effects
      of their exertions. The men to whom we owe it that we have a House of
      Commons are sneered at because they did not suffer the debates of the
      House to be published. The authors of the Toleration Act are treated as
      bigots, because they did not go the whole length of Catholic Emancipation.
      Just so we have heard a baby, mounted on the shoulders of its father, cry
      out, &ldquo;How much taller I am than Papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This gentleman can never want matter for pride, if he finds it so easily.
      He may boast of an indisputable superiority to all the greatest men of all
      past ages. He can read and write: Homer probably did not know a letter. He
      has been taught that the earth goes round the sun: Archimedes held that
      the sun went round the earth. He is aware that there is a place called New
      Holland: Columbus and Gama went to their graves in ignorance of the fact.
      He has heard of the Georgium Sidus: Newton was ignorant of the existence
      of such a planet. He is acquainted with the use of gunpowder: Hannibal and
      Cæsar won their <span class="pagenum">276</span><a name="link276"
       id="link276"></a>victories with sword and spear. We submit, however, that
      this is not the way in which men are to be estimated.
    </p>
    <p>
      We submit that a wooden spoon of our day would not be justified in calling
      Galileo and Napier blockheads, because they never heard of the
      differential calculus. We submit that Caxton&rsquo;s press in Westminster Abbey,
      rude as it is, ought to be looked at with quite as much respect as the
      best constructed machinery that ever, in our time, impressed the clearest
      type on the finest paper. Sydenham first discovered that the cool regimen
      succeeded best in cases of small-pox. By this discovery he saved the lives
      of hundreds of thousands; and we venerate his memory for it, though he
      never heard of inoculation. Lady Mary Montague brought inoculation into
      use; and we respect her for it, though she never heard of vaccination.
      Jenner introduced vaccination; we admire him for it, and we shall continue
      to admire him for it, although some still safer and more agreeable
      preservative should be discovered. It is thus that we ought to judge of
      the events and the men of other times. They were behind us. It could not
      be otherwise. But the question with respect to them is not where they
      were, but which way they were going. Were their faces set in the right or
      in the wrong direction? Were they in the front or in the rear of their
      generation? Did they exert themselves to help onward the great movement of
      the human race, or to stop it? This is not charity, but simple justice and
      common sense. It is the fundamental law of the world in which we live that
      truth shall grow, first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn
      in the ear. A person who complains of the men of 1688 for not having been
      men of 1885 might just as well complain of a projectile for describing
      <span class="pagenum">277</span><a name="link277" id="link277"></a>a
      parabola, or of quicksilver for being heavier than water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly we ought to look at ancient transactions by the light of
      modern knowledge. Undoubtedly it is among the first duties of a historian
      to point out the faults of the eminent men of former generations. There
      are no errors which are so likely to be drawn into precedent, and
      therefore none which it is so necessary to expose, as the errors of
      persons who have a just title to the gratitude and admiration of
      posterity. In politics, as in religion, there are devotees who show their
      reverence for a departed saint by converting his tomb into a sanctuary for
      crime. Receptacles of wickedness are suffered to remain undisturbed in the
      neighbourhood of the church which glories in the relics of some martyred
      apostle. Because he was merciful, his bones give security to assassins.
      Because he was chaste, the precinct of his temple is filled with licensed
      stews. Privileges of an equally absurd kind have been set up against the
      jurisdiction of political philosophy. Vile abuses cluster thick round
      every glorious event, round every venerable name; and this evil assuredly
      calls for vigorous measures of literary police. But the proper course is
      to abate the nuisance without defacing the shrine, to drive out the gangs
      of thieves and prostitutes without doing foul and cowardly wrong to the
      ashes of the illustrious dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this respect, two historians of our own time may be proposed as models,
      Sir James Mackintosh and Mr. Mill. Differing in most things, in this they
      closely resemble each other. Sir James is lenient. Mr. Mill is severe. But
      neither of them ever omits, in the apportioning of praise and of censure,
      to make ample allowance for the state of political science and political
      morality <span class="pagenum">278</span><a name="link278" id="link278"></a>in
      former ages. In the work before us, Sir James Mackintosh speaks with just
      respect of the Whigs of the Revolution, while he never fails to condemn
      the conduct of that party towards the members of the Church of Rome. His
      doctrines are the liberal and benevolent doctrines of the nineteenth
      century. But he never forgets that the men whom he is describing were men
      of the seventeenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Mr. Mill this indulgence, or, to speak more properly, this justice,
      was less to be expected. That gentleman, in some of his works, appears to
      consider politics not as an experimental, and therefore a progressive
      science, but as a science of which all the difficulties may be resolved by
      short synthetical arguments drawn from truths of the most vulgar
      notoriety. Were this opinion well founded, the people of one generation
      would have little or no advantage over those of another generation. But
      though Mr. Mill, in some of his Essays, has been thus misled, as we
      conceive, by a fondness for neat and precise forms of demonstration, it
      would be gross injustice not to admit that, in his History, he has
      employed a very different method of investigation with eminent ability and
      success. We know no writer who takes so much pleasure in the truly useful,
      noble, and philosophical employment of tracing the progress of sound
      opinions from their embryo state to their full maturity. He eagerly culls
      from old despatches and minutes every expression in which he can discern
      the imperfect germ of any great truth which has since been fully
      developed. He never fails to bestow praise on those who, though far from
      coming up to his standard of perfection, yet rose in a small degree above
      the common level of their contemporaries. It is thus that the annals of
      past times ought to be written. <span class="pagenum">279</span><a
      name="link279" id="link279"></a>It is thus, especially, that the annals of
      our own country ought to be written.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of England is emphatically the history of progress. It is the
      history of a constant movement of the public mind, of a constant change in
      the institutions of a great society. We see that society, at the beginning
      of the twelfth century, in a state more miserable than the state in which
      the most degraded nations of the East now are. We see it subjected to the
      tyranny of a handful of armed foreigners. We see a strong distinction of
      caste separating the victorious Norman from the vanquished Saxon. We see
      the great body of the population in a state of personal slavery. We see
      the most debasing and cruel superstition exercising boundless dominion
      over the most elevated and benevolent minds. We see the multitude sunk in
      brutal ignorance, and the studious few engaged in acquiring what did not
      deserve the name of knowledge. In the course of seven centuries the
      wretched and degraded race have become the greatest and most highly
      civilised people that ever the world saw, have spread their dominion over
      every quarter of the globe, have scattered the seeds of mighty empires and
      republics over vast continents of which no dim intimation had ever reached
      Ptolemy or Strabo, have created a maritime power which would annihilate in
      a quarter of an hour the navies of Tyre, Athens, Carthage, Venice, and
      Genoa together, have earned the science of healing, the means of
      locomotion and correspondence, every mechanical art, every manufacture,
      every thing that promotes the convenience of life, to a perfection which
      our ancestors would have thought magical, have produced a literature which
      may boast of works not inferior to the noblest which Greece has <span
      class="pagenum">280</span><a name="link280" id="link280"></a>bequeathed to
      us, have discovered the laws which regulate the motions of the heavenly
      bodies, have speculated with exquisite subtilty on the operations of the
      human mind, have been the acknowledged leaders of the human race in the
      career of political improvement. The history of England is the history of
      this great change in the moral, intellectual, and physical state of the
      inhabitants of our own island. There is much amusing and instructive
      episodical matter; but this is the main action. To us, we will own,
      nothing is so interesting and delightful as to contemplate the steps by
      which the England of Domesday Book, the England of the Curfew and the
      Forest Laws, the England of crusaders, monks, schoolmen, astrologers,
      seifs, outlaws, became the England which we know and love, the classic
      ground of liberty and philosophy, the school of all knowledge, the mart of
      all trade. The Charter of Henry Beauclerk, the Great Charter, the first
      assembling of the House of Commons, the extinction of personal slavery,
      the separation from the See of Rome, the Petition of Right, the Habeas
      Corpus Act, the Revolution, the establishment of the liberty of unlicensed
      printing the abolition of religious disabilities, the reform of the
      representative system, all these seem to us to be the successive stages of
      one great revolution; nor can we fully comprehend any one of these
      memorable events unless we look at it in connection with those which
      preceded, and with those which followed it. Each of those great and ever
      memorable struggles, Saxon against Norman, Villein against Lord,
      Protestant against Papist, Roundhead against Cavalier, Dissenter against
      Churchman, Manchester against Old Sa-rum, was, in its own order and
      season, a struggle, on the result of which were staked the dearest
      interests of the <span class="pagenum">281</span><a name="link281"
       id="link281"></a>human race; and every man who, in the contest which, in
      his time, divided our country, distinguished himself on the right side, is
      entitled to our gratitude and respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the editor of this book may think, those persons who estimate
      most correctly the value of the improvements which have recently been made
      in our institutions, are precisely the persons who are least disposed to
      speak slightingly of what was done in 1688. Such men consider the
      Revolution as a reform, imperfect indeed, but still most beneficial to the
      English people and to the human race, as a reform which has been the
      fruitful parent of reforms, as a reform, the happy effects of which are at
      this moment felt, not only throughout our own country, but in half the
      monarchies of Europe, and in the depths of the forests of Ohio. We shall
      be pardoned, we hope, if we call the attention of our readers to the
      causes and to the consequences of that great event.
    </p>
    <p>
      We said that the history of England is the history of progress; and, when
      we take a comprehensive view of it, it is so. But, when examined in small
      separate portions, it may with more propriety be called a history of
      actions and re-actions. We have often thought that the motion of the
      public mind in our country resembles that of the sea when the tide is
      rising. Each successive wave rushes forward, breaks, and rolls back; but
      the great flood is steadily coming in. A person who looked on the waters
      only for a moment might fancy that they were retiring. A person who looked
      on them only for five minutes might fancy that they were rushing
      capriciously to and fro. But when he keeps his eye on them for a quarter
      of an hour, and sees one sea-mark disappear after another, it is
      impossible for him to doubt of the general direction in which <span
      class="pagenum">282</span><a name="link282" id="link282"></a>the ocean is
      moved. Just such has been the course of events in England. In the history
      of the national mind, which is, in truth, the history of the nation, we
      must carefully distinguish between that recoil which regularly follows
      every advance and a great general ebb. If we take short intervals, if we
      compare 1640 and 1660, 1680 and 1685, 1708 and 1712, 1782 and 1794, we
      find a retrogression. But if we take centuries, if, for example, we
      compare 1794 with 1660 or with 1685, we cannot doubt in which direction
      society is proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interval which elapsed between the Restoration and the Revolution
      naturally divides itself into three periods. The first extends from 1660
      to 1678, the second from 1678 to 1681, the third from 1681 to 1688.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1660 the whole nation was mad with loyal excitement. If we had to
      choose a lot from among all the multitude of those which men have drawn
      since the beginning of the world, we would select that of Charles the
      Second on the day of his return. He was in a situation in which the
      dictates of ambition coincided with those of benevolence, in which it was
      easier to be virtuous than to be wicked, to be loved, than to be hated, to
      earn pure and imperishable glory than to become infamous. For once the
      road of goodness was a smooth descent. He had done nothing to merit the
      affection of his people. But they had paid him in advance without measure.
      Elizabeth, after the destruction of the Armada, or after the abolition of
      monopolies, had not excited a thousandth part of the enthusiasm with which
      the young exile was welcomed home. He was not, like Lewis the Eighteenth,
      imposed on his subjects by foreign conquerors; nor did he, like Lewis the
      Eighteenth, come back to a country <span class="pagenum">283</span><a
      name="link283" id="link283"></a>which had undergone a complete change. The
      house of Bourbon was placed in Paris as a trophy of the victory of the
      European confederation. The return of the ancient princes was inseparably
      associated in the public mind with the cession of extensive provinces,
      with the payment of an immense tribute, with the devastation of
      flourishing departments, with the occupation of the kingdom by hostile
      armies, with the emptiness of those niches in which the gods of Athens and
      Rome had been the objects of a new idolatry, with the nakedness of those
      walls on which the Transfiguration had shone with light as glorious as
      that which overhung Mount Tabor. They came back to a land in which they
      could recognise nothing. The seven sleepers of the legend, who closed
      their eyes when the Pagans were persecuting the Christians, and woke when
      the Christians were persecuting each other, did not find themselves in a
      world more completely new to them. Twenty years had done the work of
      twenty generations. Events had come thick. Men had lived fast. The old
      institutions and the old feelings had been torn up by the roots. There was
      a new Church founded and endowed by the usurper; a new nobility whose
      titles were taken from fields of battle, disastrous to the ancient line; a
      new chivalry whose crosses had been won by exploits which had seemed
      likely to make the banishment of the emigrants perpetual. A new code was
      administered by a new magistracy. A new body of proprietors held the soil
      by a new tenure. The most ancient local distinctions had been effaced. The
      most familiar names had become obsolete. There was no longer a Normandy or
      a Burgundy, a Brittany or a Guienne. The France of Lewis the Sixteenth had
      passed away as completely as one of the Preadamite <span class="pagenum">284</span><a
      name="link284" id="link284"></a>worlds. Its fossil remains might now and
      then excite curiosity. But it was as impossible to put life into the old
      institutions as to animate the skeletons which are embedded in the depths
      of primeval strata. It was as absurd to think that France could again be
      placed under the feudal system, as that our globe could be overrun by
      mammoths. The revolution in the laws and in the form of government was but
      an outward sign of that mightier revolution which had taken place in the
      heart and brain of the people, and which affected every transaction of
      life, trading, farming, studying, marrying, and giving in marriage. The
      French whom the emigrant prince had to govern were no more like the French
      of his youth, than the French of his youth were like the French of the
      Jaquerie. He came back to a people who knew not him nor his house, to a
      people to whom a Bourbon was no more than a Carlovin-gian or a
      Merovingian. He might substitute the white flag for the tricolor; he might
      put lilies in the place of bees; he might order the initials of the
      Emperor to be carefully effaced. But he could turn his eyes nowhere
      without meeting some object which reminded him that he was a stranger in
      the palace of his fathers. He returned to a country in which even the
      passing traveller is every moment reminded that there has lately been a
      great dissolution and reconstruction of the social system. To win the
      hearts of a people, under such circumstances, would have been no easy task
      even for Henry the Fourth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the English Revolution the case was altogether different. Charles was
      not imposed on his countrymen, but sought by them. His restoration was not
      attended by any circumstance which could inflict a wound on their national
      pride. Insulated by our geographical <span class="pagenum">285</span><a
      name="link285" id="link285"></a>position, insulated by our character, we
      had fought out our quarrels and effected our reconciliation among
      ourselves. Our great internal questions had never been mixed up with the
      still greater question of national independence. The political doctrines
      of the Roundheads were not, like those of the French philosophers,
      doctrines of universal application. Our ancestors, for the most part, took
      their stand, not on a general theory, but on the particular constitution
      of the realm. They asserted the rights, not of men, but of Englishmen.
      Their doctrines therefore were not contagious; and, had it been otherwise,
      no neighbouring country was then susceptible of the contagion. The
      language in which our discussions were generally conducted was scarcely
      known even to a single man of letters out of the islands. Our local
      situation made it almost impossible that we should effect great conquests
      on the Continent. The kings of Europe had, therefore, no reason to fear
      that their subjects would follow the example of the English Puritans, and
      looked with indifference, perhaps with complacency, on the death of the
      monarch and the abolition of the monarchy. Clarendon complains bitterly of
      their apathy. But we believe that this apathy was of the greatest service
      to the royal cause. If a French or Spanish army had invaded England, and
      if that army had been cut to pieces, as we have no doubt that it would
      have been, on the first day on which it came face to face with the
      soldiers of Preston and Dunbar, with Colonel-Fight-the-good-Fight, and
      Captain Smite-them-hip-and-thigh, the House of Cromwell would probably now
      have been reigning in England. The nation would have forgotten all the
      misdeeds of the man who had cleared the soil of foreign invaders. <span
      class="pagenum">286</span><a name="link286" id="link286"></a>Happily for
      Charles, no European state, even when at war with the Commonwealth, chose
      to bind up its cause with that of the wanderers who were playing in the
      garrets of Paris and Cologne at being princes and chancellors. Under the
      administration of Cromwell, England was more respected and dreaded than
      any power in Christendom; and, even under the ephemeral governments which
      followed his death, no foreign state ventured to treat her with contempt.
      Thus Charles came back, not as a mediator between his people and a
      victorious enemy, but as a mediator between internal factions. He found
      the Scotch Covenanters and the Irish Papists alike subdued. He found
      Dunkirk and Jamaica added to the empire. He was heir to the conquests and
      to the influence of the able usurper who had excluded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old government of England, as it had been far milder than the old
      government of France, had been far less violently and completely
      subverted. The national institutions had been spared, or imperfectly
      eradicated. The laws had undergone little alteration. The tenures of the
      soil were still to be learned from Littleton and Coke. The Great Charter
      was mentioned with as much reverence in the parliaments of the
      Commonwealth as in those of any earlier or of any later age. A new
      Confession of Faith and a new ritual had been introduced into the church.
      But the bulk of the ecclesiastical property still remained. The colleges
      still held their estates. The parson still received his tithes. The Lords
      had, at a crisis of great excitement, been excluded by military violence
      from their House; but they retained their titles and an ample share of the
      public veneration. When a nobleman made his appearance in the House of
      Commons he was received with ceremonious <span class="pagenum">287</span><a
      name="link287" id="link287"></a>respect. Those few Peers who consented to
      assist at the inauguration of the Protector were placed next to himself,
      and the most honourable offices of the day were assigned to them. We learn
      from the debates of Richard&rsquo;s Parliament how strong a hold the old
      aristocracy had on the affections of the people. One member of the House
      of Commons went so far as to say that, unless their Lordships were
      peaceably restored, the country might soon be convulsed by a war of the
      Barons. There was indeed no great party hostile to the Upper House. There
      was nothing exclusive in the constitution of that body. It was regularly
      recruited from among the most distinguished of the country gentlemen, the
      lawyers, and the clergy. The most powerful nobles of the century which
      preceded the civil war, the Duke of Somerset, the Duke of Northumberland,
      Lord Seymour of Sudeley, the Earl of Leicester, Lord Burleigh, the Earl of
      Salisbury, the Duke of Buckingham, the Earl of Strafford, had all been
      commoners, and had all raised themselves, by courtly arts or by
      parliamentary talents, not merely to seats in the House of Lords, but to
      the first influence in that assembly. Nor had the general conduct of the
      Peers been such as to make them unpopular. They had not, indeed, in
      opposing arbitrary measures shown so much eagerness and pertinacity as the
      Commons. But still they had opposed those measures. They had, at the
      beginning of the discontents, a common interest with the people. If
      Charles had succeeded in his scheme of governing without parliaments, the
      consequence of the Peers would have been grievously diminished. If he had
      been able to raise taxes by his own authority, the estates of the Peers
      would have been as much at his mercy as those of the merchants or the
      farmers. If he had obtained <span class="pagenum">288</span><a
      name="link288" id="link288"></a>the power of imprisoning his subjects at
      his pleasure, a Peer ran far greater risk of incurring the royal
      displeasure, and of being accommodated with apartments in the Tower, than
      any city trader or country squire. Accordingly Charles found that the
      Great Council of Peers which he convoked at York would do nothing for him.
      In the most useful reforms which were made during the first session of the
      Long Parliament, the Peers concurred heartily with the Lower House; and a
      large and powerful minority of the English nobles stood by the popular
      side through the first years of the war. At Edgehill, Newbury, gars ton,
      and Naseby, the armies of the Parliament were commanded by members of the
      aristocracy. It was not forgotten that a Peer had imitated the example of
      Hampden in refusing the payment of the ship-money, or that a Peer had been
      among the six members of the legislature whom Charles illegally impeached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the old constitution of England was without difficulty reestablished;
      and of all the parts of the old constitution the monarchical part was, at
      the time, dearest to the body of the people. It had been injudiciously
      depressed, and it was in consequence unduly exalted. From the day when
      Charles the First became a prisoner had commenced a reaction in favour of
      his person and of his office. From the day when the axe fell on his neck
      before the windows of his palace, that reaction became rapid and violent.
      At the Restoration it had attained such a point that it could go no
      further. The people were ready to place at the mercy of their Sovereign
      all their most ancient and precious rights. The most servile doctrines
      were publicly avowed. The most moderate and constitutional opposition was
      condemned. Resistance was spoken of with <span class="pagenum">289</span><a
      name="link289" id="link289"></a>more horror than any crime which a human
      being can commit. The Commons were more eager than the King himself to
      avenge the wrongs of the royal house; more desirous than the bishops
      themselves to restore the church; more ready to give money than the
      ministers to ask for it. They abrogated the excellent law passed in the
      first session of the Long Parliament, with the general consent of all
      honest men, to insure the frequent meeting of the great council of the
      nation. They might probably have been induced to go further, and to
      restore the High Commission and the Star Chamber. All the contemporary
      accounts represent the nation as in a state of hysterical excitement, of
      drunken joy. In the immense multitude which crowded the beach at Dover,
      and bordered the road along which the King travelled to London, there was
      not one who was not weeping. Bonfires blazed. Bells jingled. The streets
      were thronged at night by boon-companions, who forced all the passers-by
      to swallow on bended knees brimming glasses to the health of his Most
      Sacred Majesty, and the damnation of Rednosed Noll. That tenderness to the
      fallen which has, through many generations, been a marked feature of the
      national character, was for a time hardly discernible. All London crowded
      to shout and laugh round the gibbet where hung the rotting remains of a
      prince who had made England the dread of the world, who had been the chief
      founder of her maritime greatness and of her colonial empire, who had
      conquered Scotland and Ireland, who had humbled Holland and Spain, the
      terror of whose name had been as a guard round every English traveller in
      remote countries, and round every Protestant congregation in the heart of
      Catholic empires. When some of those brave and honest <span class="pagenum">290</span><a
      name="link290" id="link290"></a>though misguided men who had sat in
      judgment on their King were dragged on hurdles to a death of prolonged
      torture, their last prayers were interrupted by the hisses and execrations
      of thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was England in 1660. In 1678 the whole face of things had changed. At
      the former of those epochs eighteen years of commotion had made the
      majority of the people ready to buy repose at any price. At the latter
      epoch eighteen years of misgovernment had made the same majority desirous
      to obtain security for their liberties at any risk. The fury of their
      returning loyalty had spent itself in its first outbreak. In a very few
      months they had hanged and half-hanged, quartered and embowelled enough to
      satisfy them. The Roundhead party seemed to be not merely overcome, but
      too much broken and scattered ever to rally again. Then commenced the
      reflux of public opinion. The nation began to find out to what a man it
      had intrusted without conditions, all its dearest interests, on what a man
      it had lavished all its fondest affection. On the ignoble nature of the
      restored exile, adversity had exhausted all her discipline in vain. He had
      one immense advantage over most other princes. Though born in the purple,
      he was far better acquainted with the vicissitudes of life and the
      diversities of character than most of his subjects, He had known
      restraint, danger, penury, and dependence. He had often suffered from
      ingratitude, insolence, and treachery. He had received many signal proofs
      of faithful and heroic attachment He had seen, if ever man saw, both sides
      of human nature. But only one side remained in his memory. He had learned
      only to despise and to distrust his species, to consider integrity in men,
      and modesty in women, as mere acting; nor did he think it worth <span
      class="pagenum">291</span><a name="link291" id="link291"></a>while to keep
      his opinion to himself. He was incapable of friendship; yet he was
      perpetually led by favourites without being in the smallest degree duped
      by them. He knew that their regard to his interests was all simulated; but
      from a certain easiness which had no connection with humanity, he
      submitted, half-laughing at himself, to be made the tool of any woman
      whose person attracted him, or of any man whose tattle diverted him. He
      thought little and cared less about religion. He seems to have passed his
      life in dawdling suspense between Hobbism and Popery. He was crowned in
      his youth with the Covenant in his hand; he died at last with the Host
      sticking in his throat, and, during most of the intermediate years, was
      occupied in persecuting both Covenanters and Catholics. He was not a
      tyrant from the ordinary motives. He valued power for its own sake little,
      and fame still less. He does not appear to have been vindictive, or to
      have found any pleasing excitement in cruelty. What he wanted was to be
      amused, to get through the twenty-four hours pleasantly without sitting
      down to dry business. Sauntering was, as Sheffield expresses it, the true
      Sultana Queen of his Majesty&rsquo;s affections. A sitting in council would have
      been insupportable to him if the Duke of Buckingham had not been there to
      make mouths at the Chancellor. It has been said, and is highly probable,
      that in his exile he was quite disposed to sell his rights to Cromwell for
      a good round sum. To the last, his only quarrel with his Parliaments was
      that they often gave him trouble, and would not always give him money. If
      there was a person for whom he felt a real regard, that person was his
      brother. If there was a point about which he really entertained a scruple
      of conscience or of honour, that point was the descent <span
      class="pagenum">292</span><a name="link292" id="link292"></a>of the crown.
      Yet he was willing to consent to the Exclusion Bill for six hundred
      thousand pounds; and the negotiation was broken off only because he
      insisted on being paid beforehand. To do him justice, his temper was good;
      his manners agreeable; his natural talents above mediocrity. But he was
      sensual, frivolous, false, and cold-hearted, beyond almost any prince of
      whom history makes mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the government of such a man, the English people could not be long
      in recovering from the intoxication of loyalty. They were then, as they
      are still, a brave, proud, and high-spirited race, unaccustomed to defeat,
      to shame, or to servitude. The splendid administration of Oliver had
      taught them to consider their country as a match for the greatest empires
      of the earth, as the first of maritime powers, as the head of the
      Protestant interest. Though, in the day of their affectionate enthusiasm,
      they might sometimes extol the royal prerogative in tenus which would have
      better become the courtiers of Aurungzebe, they were not men whom it was
      quite safe to take at their word. They were much more perfect in the
      theory than in the practice of passive obedience. Though they might deride
      the austere manners and scriptural phrases of the Puritans they were still
      at heart a religious people. The majority saw no great sin in
      field-sports, stage-plays, promiscuous dancing, cards, fairs, starch, or
      false hair. But gross profaneness and licentiousness were regarded with
      general horror; and the Catholic religion was held in utter detestation by
      nine tenths of the middle class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the nation which, awaking from its rapturous trance, found itself
      sold to a foreign, a despotic, a Popish court, defeated on its own seas
      and rivers <span class="pagenum">293</span><a name="link293" id="link293"></a>by
      a state of far inferior resources, and placed under the rule of pandars
      and buffoons. Our ancestors saw the best and ablest divines of the age
      turned out of their benefices by hundreds. They saw the prisons filled
      with men guilty of no other crime than that of worshipping God according
      to the fashion generally prevailing throughout Protestant Europe. They saw
      a Popish Queen on the throne, and a Popish heir on the steps of the
      throne. They saw unjust aggression followed by feeble war, and feeble war
      ending in disgraceful peace. They saw a Dutch fleet riding triumphant in
      the Thames. They saw the Triple Alliance broken, the Exchequer shut up,
      the public credit shaken, the arms of England employed, in shameful
      subordination to France, against a country which seemed to be the last
      asylum of civil and religious liberty. They saw Ireland discontented, and
      Scotland in rebellion. They saw, meantime, Whitehall swarming with
      sharpers and courtesans. They saw harlot after harlot, and bastard after
      bastard, not only raised to the highest honours of the peerage, but
      supplied out of the spoils of the honest, industrious, and ruined public
      creditor, with ample means of supporting the new dignity. The government
      became more odious every day. Even in the bosom of that very House of
      Commons which had been elected by the nation in the ecstasy of its
      penitence, of its joy, and of its hope, an opposition sprang up and became
      powerful. Loyalty which had been proof against all the disasters of the
      civil war, which had survived the routs of Naseby and Worcester, which had
      never flinched from sequestration and exile, which the Protector could
      never intimidate or seduce, began to fail in this last and hardest trial.
      The storm had long been gathering. At <span class="pagenum">294</span><a
      name="link294" id="link294"></a>length it burst with a fury which
      threatened the whole frame of society with dissolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the general election of January, 1679, took place, the nation had
      retraced the path which it had been describing from 1640 to 1660. It was
      again in the same mood in which it had been when, after twelve years of
      misgovernment, the Long Parliament assembled. In every part of the
      country, the name of courtier had become a by-word of reproach. The old
      warriors of the Covenant again ventured out of those retreats in which
      they had, at the time of the Restoration, hidden themselves from the
      insults of the triumphant Malignants, and in which, during twenty rears,
      they had preserved in full vigour <br /><br /><span class="indent25">"The
      unconquerable will <br /><span class="indent20">And study of revenge,
      immortal hate, <br /><span class="indent20">With courage never to submit or
      yield, <br /><span class="indent20">And what is else not to be overcome.&rdquo;
       </span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then were again seen in the streets faces which called up strange and
      terrible recollections of the days when the saints, with the high praises
      of God in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hands, had bound
      kings with chains, and nobles with links of iron. Then were again heard
      voices which had shouted &ldquo;Privilege&rdquo; by the coach of Charles I. in the
      time of his tyranny, and had called for &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; in Westminster Hall on
      the day of his trial. It has been the fashion to represent the excitement
      of this period as the effect of the Popish plot. To us it seems clear that
      the Popish plot was rather the effect than the cause of the general
      agitation. It was not the disease, but a symptom, though, like many other
      symptoms, it aggravated the severity of the disease. In 1660 or 1661 it
      would have been utterly out of <span class="pagenum">295</span><a
      name="link295" id="link295"></a>the power of such men as Oates or Bedloe
      to give any serious disturbance to the Government. They would have been
      laughed at, pilloried, well pelted, soundly whipped, and speedily
      forgotten. In 1678 or 1679 there would have been an outbreak, if those men
      had never been born. For years things had been steadily tending to such a
      consummation. Society was one vast mass of combustible matter. No mass so
      vast and so combustible ever waited long for a spark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rational men, we suppose, are now fully agreed that by far the greater
      part, if not the whole, of Oates&rsquo;s story was a pure fabrication. It is
      indeed highly probable that, during his intercourse with the Jesuits, he
      may have heard much wild talk about the best means of reestablishing the
      Catholic religion in England, and that from some of the absurd daydreams
      of the zealots with whom he then associated he may have taken hints for
      his narrative. But we do not believe that he was privy to any thing which
      deserved the name of conspiracy. And it is quite certain that, if there be
      any small portion of truth in his evidence, that portion is so deeply
      buried in falsehood that no human skill can now effect a separation. We
      must not, however, forget, that we see his story by the light of much
      information which his contemporaries did not at first possess. We have
      nothing to say for the witnesses, but something in mitigation to offer on
      behalf of the public. We own that the credulity which the nation showed on
      that occasion seems to us, though censurable indeed, yet not wholly
      inexcusable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our ancestors knew, from the experience of several generations at home and
      abroad, how restless and encroaching was the disposition of the Church of
      Rome. <span class="pagenum">296</span><a name="link296" id="link296"></a>The
      heir-apparent of the crown was a bigoted member of that church. The
      reigning King seemed far more inclined to show favour to that church than
      to the Presbyterians. He was the intimate ally, or rather the hired
      servant, of a powerful King, who had already given proofs of his
      determination to tolerate within his dominions no other religion than that
      of Rome. The Catholics had begun to talk a bolder language than formerly,
      and to anticipate the restoration of their worship in all its ancient
      dignity and splendour. At this juncture, it is rumoured that a Popish plot
      has been discovered. A distinguished Catholic is arrested on suspicion. It
      appears that he has destroyed almost all his papers. A few letters,
      however, have escaped the flames; and these letters are found to contain
      much alarming matter, strange expressions about subsidies from France,
      allusions to a vast scheme which would &ldquo;give the greatest blow to the
      Protestant religion that it had ever received,&rdquo; and which &ldquo;would utterly
      subdue a pestilent heresy.&rdquo; It was natural that those who saw these
      expressions, in letters which had been overlooked, should suspect that
      there was some horrible villany in those which had been carefully
      destroyed. Such was the feeling of the House of Commons: &ldquo;Question,
      question, Coleman&rsquo;s letters!&rdquo; was the cry which drowned the voices of the
      minority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just after the discovery of these papers, a magistrate who had been
      distinguished by his independent spirit, and who had taken the deposition
      of the informer, is found murdered, under circumstances which make it
      almost incredible that he should have fallen either by robbers or by his
      own hands. Many of our readers can remember the state of London just after
      the murders <span class="pagenum">297</span><a name="link297" id="link297"></a>of
      Mar and Williamson, the terror which was on every face, the careful
      barring of doors, the providing of blunderbusses and watchmen&rsquo;s rattles.
      We know of a shopkeeper who on that occasion sold three hundred rattles in
      about ten hours. Those who remember that panic may be able to form some
      notion of the state of England after the death of Godfrey. Indeed, we must
      say that, after having read and weighed all the evidence now extant on
      that mysterious subject, we incline to the opinion that he was
      assassinated, and assassinated by Catholics, not assuredly by Catholics of
      the least weight or note, but by some of those crazy and vindictive
      fanatics who may be found in every large sect, and who are peculiarly
      likely to be found in a persecuted sect. Some of the violent Cameronians
      had recently, under similar exasperation, committed similar crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was natural that there should be a panic; and it was natural that the
      people should, in a panic, be unreasonable and credulous. It must be
      remembered also that they had not at first, as we have, the means of
      comparing the evidence which was given on different trials. They were not
      aware of one tenth part of the contradictions and absurdities which Oates
      had committed. The blunders, for example, into which he fell before the
      Council, his mistake about the person of Don John of Austria, and about
      the situation of the Jesuits&rsquo; College at Paris, were not publicly known.
      He was a bad man; but the spies and deserters by whom governments are
      informed of conspiracies are generally bad men. His story was strange and
      romantic; but it was not more strange or romantic than a
      well-authenticated Popish plot, which some few people then living might
      remember, the Gunpowder treason. Oates&rsquo;s account of the burning of London
      was in itself not more im <span class="pagenum">298</span><a name="link298"
       id="link298"></a>probable than the project of blowing up King, Lords, and
      Commons, a project which had not only been entertained by very
      distinguished Catholics, but which had very narrowly missed of success. As
      to the design on the King&rsquo;s person, all the world knew that, within a
      century, two kings of France and a prince of Orange had been murdered by
      Catholics, purely from religious enthusiasm, that Elizabeth had been in
      constant danger of a similar fate, and that such attempts, to say the
      least, had not been discouraged by the highest authority of the Church of
      Rome. The characters of some of the accused persons stood high; but so did
      that of Anthony Babington, and that of Everard Digby. Those who suffered
      denied their guilt to the last; but no persons versed in criminal
      proceedings would attach any importance to this circumstance. It was well
      known also that the most distinguished Catholic casuists had written
      largely in defence of regicide, of mental reservation and of equivocation.
      It was not quite impossible that men whose minds had been nourished with
      the writings of such casuists might think themselves justified in denying
      a charge which, if acknowledged, would bring great scandal on the Church.
      The trials of the accused Catholics were exactly like all the state trials
      of those days; that is to say, as infamous as they could be. They were
      neither fairer nor less fair than those of Algernon Sydney, of Rosewell,
      of Cornish, of all the unhappy men, in short, whom a predominant party
      brought to what was then facetiously called justice. Till the Revolution
      purified our institutions and our manners, a state-trial was merely a
      murder preceded by the uttering of certain gibberish and the performance
      of certain mummeries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Opposition had now the great body of the <span class="pagenum">299</span><a
      name="link299" id="link299"></a>nation with them. Thrice the King
      dissolved the Parliament; and thrice the constituent body sent him back
      representatives fully determined to keep strict watch on all his measures,
      and to exclude his brother from the throne. Had the character of Charles
      resembled that of his father, this intestine discord would infallibly have
      ended in a civil war. Obstinacy and passion would have been his ruin. His
      levity and apathy were his security. He resembled one of those light
      Indian boats which are safe because they are pliant, which yield to the
      impact of every wave, and which therefore bound without danger through a
      surf in which a vessel ribbed with heart of oak would inevitably perish.
      The only thing about which his mind was unalterably made up was that, to
      use his own phrase, he would not go on his travels again for any body or
      for any thing. His easy, indolent behaviour produced all the effects of
      the most artful policy. He suffered things to take their course; and if
      Achitophel had been at one of his ears, and Machiavel at the other, they
      could have given him no better advice than to let things take their
      course. He gave way to the violence of the movement, and waited for the
      corresponding violence of the rebound. He exhibited himself to his
      subjects in the interesting character of an oppressed king, who was ready
      to do any thing to please them, and who asked of them in return, only some
      consideration for his conscientious scruples and for his feelings of
      natural affection, who was ready to accept any ministers, to grant any
      guarantees to public liberty, but who could not find it in his heart to
      take away his brother&rsquo;s birthright. Nothing more was necessary. He had to
      deal with a people whose noble weakness it has always been not to press
      too hardly on <span class="pagenum">300</span><a name="link300"
       id="link300"></a>the vanquisher, with a people the lowest and most brutal
      of whom cry &ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; if they see a man struck when he is on the ground.
      The resentment which the nation had felt towards the Court began to abate
      as soon as the Court was manifestly unable to offer any resistance. The
      panic which Godfrey&rsquo;s death had excited gradually subsided. Every day
      brought to light some new falsehood or contradiction in the stories of
      Oates and Bedloe. The people were glutted with the blood of Papists, as
      they had, twenty years before, been glutted with the blood of regicides.
      When the first sufferers in the plot were brought to the bar, the
      witnesses for the defence were in danger of being torn in pieces by the
      mob. Judges, jurors, and spectators seemed equally indifferent to justice,
      and equally eager for revenge. Lord Stafford, the last sufferer, was
      pronounced not guilty by a large minority of his peers; and when he
      protested his innocence on the scaffold, the people cried out, &ldquo;God bless
      you, my lord; we believe you, my lord.&rdquo; The attempt to make a son of Lucy
      Waters King of England was alike offensive to the pride of the nobles and
      to the moral feeling of the middle class. The old Cavalier party, the
      great majority of the landed gentry, the clergy and the universities
      almost to a man, began to draw together, and to form in close array round
      the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar reaction had begun to take place in favour of Charles the First
      during the second session of the Long Parliament; and, if that prince had
      been holiest or sagacious enough to keep himself strictly within the
      limits of the law, we have not the smallest doubt that he would in a few
      months have found himself at least as powerful as his best friends, Lord
      Falkland, Culpeper, <span class="pagenum">301</span><a name="link301"
       id="link301"></a>or Hyde, would have wished to see him. By illegally
      impeaching the leaders of the Opposition, and by making in person a wicked
      attempt on the House of Commons, he stopped and turned back that tide of
      loyal feeling which was just beginning to run strongly. The son, quite as
      little restrained by law or by honour as the father, was, luckily for
      himself, a man of a lounging, careless temper, and, from temper, we
      believe, rather than from policy, escaped that great error which cost the
      father so dear. Instead of trying to pluck the fruit before it was ripe,
      he lay still till it fell mellow into his very mouth. If he had arrested
      Lord Shaftesbury and Lord Russell in a manner not warranted by law, it is
      not improbable that he would have ended his life in exile. He took the
      sure course. He employed only his legal prerogatives, and he found them
      amply sufficient for his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first eighteen or nineteen years of his reign, he had been
      playing the game of his enemies. From 1678 to 1681, his enemies had played
      his game. They owed their power to his misgovernment. He owed the recovery
      of his power to their violence. The great body of the people came back to
      him after their estrangement with impetuous affection. He had scarcely
      been more popular when he landed on the coast of Kent than when, after
      several years of restraint and humiliation, he dissolved his last
      Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, while this flux and reflux of opinion went on, the cause of
      public liberty was steadily gaining. There had been a great reaction in
      favour of the throne at the Restoration. But the Star-Chamber, the High
      Commission, the Ship-money, had forever disappeared. There was now another
      similar reaction. But the Habeas-Corpus Act had been passed during <span
      class="pagenum">302</span><a name="link302" id="link302"></a>the short
      predominance of the Opposition, and it was not repealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, however, supported as he was by the nation, was quite strong
      enough to inflict a terrible revenge on the party which had lately held
      him in bondage. In 1681 commenced the third of those periods into which we
      have divided the history of England from the Restoration to the
      Revolution. During this period a third great reaction took place. The
      excesses of tyranny restored to the cause of liberty the hearts which had
      been alienated from that cause by the excesses of faction. In 1681, the
      King had almost his enemies at his feet. In 1688, the King was an exile in
      a strange land.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of that machinery which had lately been in motion against the
      Papists was now put in motion against the Whigs, browbeating judges,
      packed juries, lying witnesses, clamorous spectators. The ablest chief of
      the party fled to a foreign country and died there. The most virtuous man
      of the party was beheaded. Another of its most distinguished members
      preferred a voluntary death to the shame of a public execution. The
      boroughs on which the government could not depend were, by means of legal
      quibbles, deprived of their charters; and their constitution was
      remodelled in such a manner as almost to insure the return of
      representatives devoted to the Court. All parts of the kingdom emulously
      sent up the most extravagant assurances of the love which they bore to
      their sovereign, and of the abhorrence with which they regarded those who
      questioned the divine origin or the boundless extent of his power. It is
      scarcely necessary to say that, in this hot competition of bigots and
      slaves, the University of Oxford had the unquestioned preeminence. <span
      class="pagenum">303</span><a name="link303" id="link303"></a>The glory of
      being farther behind the age than any other portion of the British people,
      is one which that learned body acquired early, and has never lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles died, and his brother came to the throne; but, though the person
      of the sovereign was changed, the love and awe with which the office was
      regarded were undiminished. Indeed, it seems that, of the two princes,
      James was, in spite of his religion, rather the favourite of the High
      Church party. He had been specially singled out as the mark of the Whigs;
      and this circumstance sufficed to make him the idol of the Tories. He
      called a parliament. The loyal gentry of the counties and the packed
      voters of the remodelled boroughs gave him a parliament such as England
      had not seen for a century, a parliament beyond all comparison the most
      obsequious that ever sat under a prince of the House of Stuart. One
      insurrectionary movement, indeed, took place in England and another in
      Scotland. Both were put down with ease, and punished with tremendous
      severity. Even after that bloody circuit, which will never be forgotten
      while the English race exists in any part of the globe, no member of the
      House of Commons ventured to whisper even the mildest censure on Jeffreys.
      Edmund Waller, emboldened by his great age and his high reputation,
      attacked the cruelty of the military chiefs; and this is the brightest
      part of his long and checkered public life. But even Waller did not
      venture to arraign the still more odious cruelty of the Chief Justice. It
      is hardly too much to say that James, at that time, had little reason to
      envy the extent of authority possessed by Lewis the Fourteenth.
    </p>
    <p>
      By what means this vast power was in three years <span class="pagenum">304</span><a
      name="link304" id="link304"></a>broken down, by what perverse and frantic
      misgovernment the tyrant revived the spirit of the vanquished Whigs,
      turned to fixed hostility the neutrality of the trimmers, and drove from
      him the landed gentry, the Church, the army, his own creatures, his own
      children, is well known to our readers. But we wish to say something about
      one part of the question, which in our own time has a little puzzled some
      very worthy men, and about which the author of the Continuation before us
      has said much with which we can by no means concur.
    </p>
    <p>
      James, it is said, declared himself a supporter of toleration. If he
      violated the constitution, he at least violated it for one of the noblest
      ends that any statesman ever had in view. His object was to free millions
      of his subjects from penal laws and disabilities which hardly any person
      now considers as just. He ought, therefore, to be regarded as blameless,
      or, at worst, as guilty only of employing irregular means to effect a most
      praiseworthy purpose. A very ingenious man, whom we believe to be a
      Catholic, Mr. Banim, has written a historical novel, of the literary merit
      of which we cannot speak very highly, for the purpose of inculcating this
      opinion. The editor of Mackintosh&rsquo;s Fragment assures us, that the standard
      of James bore the nobler inscription, and so forth; the meaning of which
      is, that William and the other authors of the Revolution were vile Whigs
      who drove out James for being a Radical: that the crime of the King; was
      his going farther in liberality than his subjects; that he was the real
      champion of freedom; and that Somers, Locke, Newton, and other
      narrow-minded people of the same sort, were the real bigots and
      oppressors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we admit that if the premises can be made out, <span class="pagenum">305</span><a
      name="link305" id="link305"></a>the conclusion follows. If it can be shown
      that James did sincerely wish to establish perfect freedom of conscience,
      we shall think his conduct deserving of indulgence, if not of praise. We
      shall not be inclined to censure harshly even his illegal acts. We
      conceive that so noble and salutary an object would have justified
      resistance on the part of subjects. We can therefore scarcely deny that it
      would at least excuse encroachment on the part of a king. But it can be
      proved, we think, by the strongest evidence, that James had no such object
      in view; and that, under the pretence of establishing perfect religious
      liberty, he was trying to establish the ascendency and the exclusive
      dominion of the Church of Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that he professed himself a supporter of toleration. Every sect
      clamours for toleration when it is down. We have not the smallest doubt
      that, when Bonner was in the Marshalsea, he thought it a very hard thing
      that a man should be locked up in a gaol for not being able to understand
      the words, &ldquo;This is my body,&rdquo; in the same way with the lords of the
      council. It would not be very wise to conclude that a beggar is full of
      Christian charity, because he assures you that God will reward you if you
      give him a penny; or that a soldier is humane, because he cries out
      lustily for quarter when a bayonet is at his throat. The doctrine which,
      from the very first origin of religious dissensions, has been held by all
      bigots of all sects, when condensed into a few words, and stripped of
      rhetorical disguise, is simply this: I am in the right, and you are in the
      wrong. When you are the stronger you ought to tolerate me; for it is your
      duty to tolerate truth. But when I am the stronger, I shall persecute you;
      for it is my duty to persecute error. <span class="pagenum">306</span><a
      name="link306" id="link306"></a>The Catholics lay under severe restraints
      in England. James wished to remove those restraints; and therefore he held
      a language favourable to liberty of conscience. But the whole history of
      his life proves that this was a mere pretence. In 1679 he held similar
      language, in a conversation with the magistrates of Amsterdam; and the
      author of the Continuation refers to this circumstance as a proof that the
      King had long entertained a strong feeling on the subject. Unhappily it
      proves only the utter insincerity of all the King&rsquo;s later professions. If
      he had pretended to be converted to the doctrines of toleration after his
      accession to the throne, some credit might have been due to him. But we
      know most certainly that, in 1679, and long after that year, James was a
      most bloody and remorseless persecutor. After 1679, he was placed at the
      head of the government of Scotland. And what had been his conduct in that
      country? He had hunted down the scattered remnant of the Covenanters with
      a barbarity of which no other prince of modern times, Philip the Second
      excepted, had ever shown himself capable. He had indulged himself in the
      amusement of seeing the torture of the Boot inflicted on the wretched
      enthusiasts whom persecution had driven to resistance. After his
      accession, almost his first act was to obtain from the servile parliament
      of Scotland a law for inflicting death on preachers at conventicles held
      within houses, and on both preachers and hearers at conventicles held in
      the open air. All this he had done for a religion which was not his own.
      All this he had done, not in defence of truth against error, but in
      defence of one damnable error against another, in defence of the
      Episcopalian against the Presbyterian apostasy. Lewis the Fourteenth is
      justly censured for <span class="pagenum">307</span><a name="link307"
       id="link307"></a>trying to dragoon his subjects to heaven. But it was
      reserved for James to torture and murder for the difference between two
      roads to hell. And this man, so deeply imbued with the poison of
      intolerance that, rather than not persecute at all, he would persecute
      people out of one heresy into another, this man is held up as the champion
      of religious liberty. This man, who persecuted in the cause of the unclean
      panther, would not, we are told, have persecuted for the sake of the
      milk-white and immortal hind.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what was the conduct of James at the very time when he was professing
      zeal for the rights of conscience? Was he not even then persecuting to the
      very best of his power? Was he not employing all his legal prerogatives,
      and many prerogatives which were not legal, for the purpose of forcing his
      subjects to conform to his creed? While he pretended to abhor the laws
      which excluded Dissenters from office, was he not himself dismissing from
      office his ablest, his most experienced, his most faithful servants, on
      account of their religious opinions? For what offence was Lord Rochester
      driven from the Treasury? He was closely connected with the Royal House.
      He was at the head of the Tory party. He had stood firmly by James in the
      most trying emergencies. But he would not change his religion, and he was
      dismissed. That we may not be suspected of overstating the case, Dr.
      Lingard, a very competent, and assuredly not a very willing witness, shall
      speak for us. &ldquo;The King,&rdquo; says that able but partial writer, &ldquo;was
      disappointed: he complained to Barillon of the obstinacy and insincerity
      of the treasurer; and the latter received from the French envoy a very
      intelligible hint that the loss of office would result from his adhesion
      to his religious <span class="pagenum">308</span><a name="link308"
       id="link308"></a>creed. He was, however, inflexible; and James, after a
      long delay, communicated to him, but with considerable embarrassment and
      many tears, his final determination. He had hoped, he said, that
      Rochester, by conforming to the Church of Rome, would have spared him the
      unpleasant task; but kings must sacrifice their feelings to their duty.&rdquo;
       And this was the King who wished to have all men of all sects rendered
      alike capable of holding office. These proceedings were alone sufficient
      to take away all credit from his liberal professions; and such, as we
      learn from the despatches of the Papal Nuncio, was really the effect.
      &ldquo;Pare,&rdquo; says D&rsquo;Adda, writing a few days after the retirement of Rochester,
      &ldquo;pare che gli animi sono inaspriti della voce che corrtrà il popolo,
      d&rsquo;esser cacciato il detto ministre per non essere Cattolico, perciô
      tirarsi al esterminio de Protestanti.&rdquo; Was it ever denied that the favours
      of the Crown were constantly bestowed and withheld purely on account of
      the religious opinions of the claimants? And if these things were done in
      the green tree, what would have been done in the dry? If James acted thus
      when he had the strongest motives to court his Protestant subjects, what
      course was he likely to follow when he had obtained from them all that he
      asked?
    </p>
    <p>
      Who again was his closest ally? And what was the policy of that ally? The
      subjects of James, it is true, did not know half the infamy of their
      sovereign. They did not know, as we know, that, while he was lecturing
      them on the blessings of equal toleration, he was constantly
      congratulating his good brother Lewis on the success of that intolerant
      policy which had turned the fairest tracts of France into deserts, and
      driven into exile myriads of the most peaceable, industrious, and skilful
      artisans in the world. But <span class="pagenum">309</span><a
      name="link309" id="link309"></a>the English did know that the two princes
      were bound together in the closest union. They saw their sovereign with
      toleration on his lips, separating himself from those states which had
      first set the example of toleration, and connecting himself by the
      strongest ties with the most faithless and merciless persecutor who could
      then be found on any continental throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      By what advice again was James guided? Who were the persons in whom he
      placed the greatest confidence, and who took the warmest interest in his
      schemes? The ambassador of France, the Nuncio of Rome, and Father Petre
      the Jesuit. And is not this enough to prove that the establishment of
      equal toleration was not his plan? Was Lewis for toleration? Was the
      Vatican for toleration? Was the order of Jesuits for toleration? We know
      that the liberal professions of James were highly approved by those very
      governments, by those very societies, whose theory and practice it
      notorious was to keep no faith with heretics and to give no quarter to
      heretics. And are we, in order to save James&rsquo;s reputation for sincerity,
      to believe that all at once those governments and those societies had
      changed their nature, had discovered the criminality of all their former
      conduct, had adopted principles far more liberal than those of Locke, of
      Leighton, or of Tillotson? Which is the more probable supposition, that
      the King who had revoked the edict of Nantes, the Pope under whose
      sanction the Inquisition was then imprisoning and burning, the religious
      order which, in every controversy in which it had ever been engaged, had
      called in the aid either of the magistrate or of the assassin, should have
      become as thorough-going friends to religious liberty as Dr. Franklin and
      Mr. Jefferson, or that <span class="pagenum">310</span><a name="link310"
       id="link310"></a>a Jesuit-ridden bigot should be induced to disemble for
      the good of the Church?
    </p>
    <p>
      The game which the Jesuits were playing was no new game. A hundred years
      before they had preached up political freedom, just as they were now
      preaching up religious freedom. They had tried to raise the republicans
      against Henry the Fourth and Elizabeth, just as they were now trying to
      raise the Protestant Dissenters against the Established Church. In the
      sixteenth century, the tools of Philip the Second were constantly
      preaching doctrines that bordered on Jacobinism, constantly insisting on
      the right of the people to cashier kings, and of every private citizen to
      plunge his dagger into the heart of a wicked ruler. In the seventeenth
      century, the persecutors of the Huguenots were crying out against the
      tyranny of the Established Church of England, and vindicating with the
      utmost fervour the right of every man to adore God after his own fashion.
      In both cases they were alike insincere. In both cases the fool who had
      trusted them would have found himself miserably duped. A good and wise man
      would doubtless disapprove of the arbitrary measures of Elizabeth. Put
      would he have really served the interests of political liberty, if he had
      put faith in the professions of the Romish casuists, joined their party,
      and taken a share in Northumberland&rsquo;s revolt, or in Babington&rsquo;s
      conspiracy? Would he not have been assisting to establish a far worse
      tyranny than that which he was trying to put down? In the same manner, a
      good and wise man would doubtless see very much to condemn in the conduct
      of the Church of England under the Stuarts. But was he therefore to join
      the King and the Catholics against that Church? <span class="pagenum">311</span><a
      name="link311" id="link311"></a>And was it not plain that, by so doing, he
      would assist in setting up a spiritual despotism, compared with which the
      despotism of the Establishment was as a little finger to the loins, as a
      rod of whips to a rod of scorpions?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis had a far stronger mind than James. He had at least an equally high
      sense of honour. He was in a much less degree the slave of his priests.
      His Protestant subjects had all the security for their rights of
      conscience which law and solemn compact could give. Had that security been
      found sufficient? And was not one such instance enough for one generation?
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan of James seems to us perfectly intelligible. The toleration
      which, with the concurrence and applause of all the most cruel persecutors
      in Europe, he was offering to his people, was meant simply to divide them.
      This is the most obvious and vulgar of political artifices. We have seen
      it employed a hundred times within our own memory. At this moment we see
      the Carlists in France hallooing on the Extreme Left against the Centre
      Left. Four years ago the same trick was practised in England. We heard old
      buyers and sellers of boroughs, men who had been seated in the House of
      Commons by the unsparing use of ejectments, and who had, through their
      whole lives, opposed every measure which tended to increase the power of
      the democracy, abusing the Reform Bill as not democratic enough, appealing
      to the labouring classes, execrating the tyranny of the ten-pound
      householders, and exchanging compliments and caresses with the most noted
      incendiaries of our time. The cry of universal toleration was employed by
      James, just as the cry of universal suffrage was lately employed by some
      veteran Tories. The object of the mock democrats of our <span
      class="pagenum">312</span><a name="link312" id="link312"></a>time was to
      produce a conflict between the middle classes and the multitude, and thus
      to prevent all reform. The object of James was to produce a conflict
      between the Church and the Protestant Dissenters, and thus to facilitate
      the victory of the Catholics over both.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not believe that he could have succeeded. But we do not think his
      plan so utterly frantic and hopeless as it has generally been thought; and
      we are sure that, if he had been allowed to gain his first point, the
      people would have had no remedy left but an appeal to physical force,
      which would have been made under most unfavourable circumstances. He
      conceived that the Tories, hampered by their professions of passive
      obedience, would have submitted to his pleasure, and that the Dissenters,
      seduced by his delusive promises of relief, would have given him strenuous
      support. In this way he hoped to obtain a law, nominally for the removal
      of all religious disabilities, but really for the excluding of all
      Protestants from all offices. It is never to be forgotten that a prince
      who has all the patronage of the state in his hands can, without violating
      the letter of the law, establish whatever test he chooses. And, from the
      whole conduct of James, we have not the smallest doubt that he would have
      availed himself of his power to the utmost. The statute-book might declare
      all Englishmen equally capable of holding office; but to what end, if all
      offices were in the gift of a sovereign resolved not to employ a single
      heretic? We firmly believe that not one post in the government, in the
      army, in the navy, on the bench, or at the bar, not one peerage, nay not
      one ecclesiastical benefice in the royal gift, would have been bestowed on
      any Protestant <span class="pagenum">313</span><a name="link313"
       id="link313"></a>of any persuasion. Even while the King had still strong
      motives to dissemble, he had made a Catholic Dean of Christ Church and a
      Catholic President of Magdalen College. There seems to be no doubt that
      the See of York was kept vacant for another Catholic. If James had been
      suffered to follow this course for twenty years, every military man from a
      general to a drummer, every officer of a ship, every judge, every King&rsquo;s
      counsel, every lord-lieutenant of a county, every justice of the peace,
      every ambassador, every minister of state, every person employed in the
      royal household, in the custom-house, in the postoffice, in the excise,
      would have been a Catholic. The Catholics would have had a majority in the
      House of Lords, even if that majority had been made, as Sunderland
      threatened, by bestowing coronets on a whole troop of the Guards.
      Catholics would have had, we believe, the chief weight even in the
      Convocation. Every bishop, every dean, every holder of a crown living,
      every head of every college which was subject to the royal power, would
      have belonged to the Church of Rome. Almost all the places of liberal
      education would have been under the direction of Catholics. The whole
      power of licensing books would have been in the hands of Catholics. All
      this immense mass of power would have been steadily supported by the arms
      and by the gold of France, and would have descended to an heir whose whole
      education would have been conducted with a view to one single end, the
      complete reestablishment of the Catholic religion. The House of Commons
      would have been the only legal obstacle. But the rights of a great portion
      of the electors were at the mercy of the courts of law; and the courts of
      law were absolutely <span class="pagenum">314</span><a name="link314"
       id="link314"></a>dependent on the Crown. We cannot therefore think it
      altogether impossible that a house might have been packed which would have
      restored the days of Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      We certainly do not believe that this would have been tamely borne. But we
      do believe that, if the nation had been deluded by the King&rsquo;s professions
      of toleration, all this would have been attempted, and could have been
      averted only by a most bloody and destructive contest, in which the whole
      Protestant population would have been opposed to the Catholics. On the one
      side would have been a vast numerical superiority. But on the other side
      would have been the whole organization of an eminent, and two great
      disciplined armies, that of James, and that of Lewis. We do not doubt that
      the nation would have achieved its deliverance. But we believe that the
      struggle would have shaken the whole fabric of society, and that the
      vengeance of the conquerors would have been terrible and unsparing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But James was stopped at the outset. He thought himself secure of the
      Tories, because they professed to consider all resistance as sinful, and
      of the Protestant Dissenters, because he offered them relief. He was in
      the wrong as to both. The error into which he fell about the Dissenters
      was very natural. But the confidence which he placed in the loyal
      assurances of the High Church party, was the most exquisitely ludicrous
      proof of folly that a politician ever gave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only imagine a man acting for one single day on the supposition that all
      his neighbours believe all that they profess, and act up to all that they
      believe. Imagine a man acting on the supposition that he may safely offer
      the deadliest injuries and insults to everybody who <span class="pagenum">315</span><a
      name="link315" id="link315"></a>says that revenge is sinful; or that he
      may safely intrust all his property without security to any person who
      says that it is wrong to steal. Such a character would be too absurd for
      the wildest farce. Yet the folly of James did not stop short of this
      incredible extent. Because the clergy had declared that resistance to
      oppression was in no case lawful, he conceived that he might oppress them
      exactly as much as he chose, without the smallest danger of resistance. He
      quite forgot that, when they magnified the royal prerogative, the
      prerogative was exerted on their side, that, when they preached endurance,
      they had nothing to endure, that, when they declared it unlawful to resist
      evil, none but Whigs and Dissenters suffered any evil. It had never
      occurred to him that a man feels the calamities of his enemies with one
      sort of sensibility, and his own with quite a different sort. It had never
      occurred to him as possible that a reverend divine might think it the duty
      of Baxter and Bunyan to bear insults and to lie in dungeons without
      murmuring, and yet, when he saw the smallest chance that his own prebend
      might be transferred to some sly Father from Italy or Flanders, might
      begin to discover much matter for useful meditation in the texts touching
      Ehud&rsquo;s knife and Jael&rsquo;s hammer. His majesty was not aware, it should seem,
      that people do sometimes reconsider their opinions; and that nothing more
      disposes a man to reconsider his opinions than a suspicion, that, if he
      adheres to them, he is very likely to be a beggar or a martyr. Yet it
      seems strange that these truths should have escaped the royal mind Those
      Churchmen who had signed the Oxford Declaration in favour of passive
      obedience had also signed the thirty-nine Articles. And yet the very man
      who confidently expected that, by a little coaxing and bullying, <span
      class="pagenum">316</span><a name="link316" id="link316"></a>he should
      induce them to renounce the Articles, was thunderstruck when he found that
      they were disposed to soften down the doctrines of the Declaration. Nor
      did it necessarily follow that, even if the theory of the Tories had
      undergone no modification, their practice would coincide with their
      theory. It might, one should think, have crossed the mind of a man of
      fifty, who had seen a great deal of the world, that people sometimes do
      what they think wrong. Though a prelate might hold that Paul directs us to
      obey even a Nero, it might not on that account he perfectly safe to treat
      the Right Reverend Father in God after the fashion of Nero, in the hope
      that he would continue to obey on the principles of Paul. The King indeed
      had only to look at home. He was at least as much attached to the Catholic
      Church as any Tory gentleman or clergyman could be to the Church of
      England. Adultery was at least as clearly and strongly condemned by his
      Church as resistance by the Church of England. Yet his priests could not
      keep him from Arabella Sedley. While he was risking his crown for the sake
      of his soul, he was risking his soul for the sake of an ugly, dirty
      mistress. There is something delightfully grotesque in the spectacle of a
      man who, while living in the habitual violation of his own known duties,
      is unable to believe that any temptation can draw any other person aside
      from the path of virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      James was disappointed in all his calculations. His hope was that the
      Tories would follow their principles, and that the Non-conformists would
      follow their interests. Exactly the reverse took place. The great body of
      the Tories sacrificed the principle of non-resistance to their interests;
      the great body of Non-conformists rejected the delusive offers of the
      King, and stood <span class="pagenum">317</span><a name="link317"
       id="link317"></a>firmly by their principles. The two parties whose strife
      had convulsed the empire during half a century were united for a moment;
      and all the vast royal power which three years before had seemed immovably
      fixed vanished at once like chaff in a hurricane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very great length to which this article has already been extended
      makes it impossible for us to discuss, as we had meant to do, the
      characters and conduct of the leading English statesmen at this crisis.
      But we must offer a few remarks on the spirit and tendency of the
      Revolution of 1688.
    </p>
    <p>
      The editor of this volume quotes the Declaration of Right, and tells us
      that, by looking at it, we may &ldquo;judge at a glance whether the authors of
      the Revolution achieved all they might and ought, in their position, to
      have achieved; whether the Commons of England did their duty to their
      constituents, their country, posterity, and universal freedom.&rdquo; We are at
      a loss to imagine how he can have read and transcribed the Declaration of
      Right, and yet have so utterly misconceived its nature. That famous
      document is, as its very name imports, declaratory, and not remedial. It
      was never meant to be a measure of reform. It neither contained, nor was
      designed to contain, any allusion to those innovations which the authors
      of the Revolution considered as desirable, and which they speedily
      proceeded to make. The Declaration was merely a recital of certain old and
      wholesome laws which had been violated by the Stuarts, and a solemn
      protest against the validity of any precedent which might be set up in
      opposition to those laws. The words run thus: &ldquo;They do claim, demand, and
      insist upon all and singular the premises as their undoubted rights and
      liberties.&rdquo; Before a man begins to make improvements on his estate, <span
      class="pagenum">318</span><a name="link318" id="link318"></a>he must know
      its boundaries. Before a legislature sits down to reform a constitution,
      it is fit to ascertain what that constitution really is. This is all that
      the Declaration was intended to do; and to quarrel with it because it did
      not directly introduce any beneficial changes is to quarrel with meat for
      not being fuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principle on which the authors of the Revolution acted cannot be
      mistaken. They were perfectly aware that the English institutions stood in
      need of reform. But they also knew that an important point was gained if
      they could settle once for all, by a solemn compact, the matters which
      had, during several generations, been in controversy between the
      Parliament and the Crown. They therefore most judiciously abstained from
      mixing up the irritating and perplexing question of what ought to be the
      law with the plain question of what was the law. As to the claims set
      forth in the Declaration of Right, there was little room for debate. Whigs
      and Tories were generally agreed as to the illegality of the dispensing
      power and of taxation imposed by the royal prerogative. The articles were
      therefore adjusted in a very few days. But if the Parliament had
      determined to revise the whole constitution, and to provide new securities
      against misgovemment, before proclaiming the new sovereigns, months would
      have been lost in disputes. The coalition which had delivered the country
      would have been instantly dissolved. The Whigs would have quarrelled with
      the Tories, the Lords with the Commons, the Church with the Dissenters;
      and all this storm of conflicting interests and conflicting theories would
      have been raging round a vacant throne. In the mean time, the greatest
      power on the Continent was attacking our allies, and meditating a descent
      on our own territories. Dundee was preparing <span class="pagenum">319</span><a
      name="link319" id="link319"></a>to raise the Highlands. The authority of
      James was still owned by the Irish. If the authors of the Revolution had
      been fools enough to take this course, we have little doubt that
      Luxembourg would have been upon them in the midst of their
      constitution-making. They might probably have been interrupted in a debate
      on Filmer&rsquo;s and Sydney&rsquo;s theories of government by the entrance of the
      musqueteers of Lewis&rsquo;s household, and have been marched off, two and two,
      to frame imaginary monarchies and commonwealths in the Tower. We have had
      in our own time abundant experience of the effects of such folly. We have
      seen nation after nation enslaved, because the friends of liberty wasted
      in discussions upon abstract questions the time which ought to have been
      employed in preparing for vigorous national defence. This editor,
      apparently, would have had the English Revolution of 1688 end as the
      Revolutions of Spain and Naples ended in our days. Thank God, our
      deliverers were men of a very different order from the Spanish and
      Neapolitan legislators. They might, on many subjects, hold opinions which,
      in the nineteenth century, would not be considered as liberal. But they
      were not dreaming pedants. They were statesmen accustomed to the
      management of great affairs. Their plans of reform were not so extensive
      as those of the lawgivers of Cadiz; but what they planned, that they
      effected; and what they effected, that they maintained against the
      fiercest hostility at home and abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their first object was to seat William on the throne; and they were right.
      We say this without any reference to the eminent personal qualities of
      William, or to the follies and crimes of James. If the two princes had
      interchanged characters, our opinion would still <span class="pagenum">320</span><a
      name="link320" id="link320"></a>have been the same. It was even more
      necessary to England at that time that her king should be a usurper than
      that he should be a hero. There could be no security for good government
      without a change of dynasty. The reverence for hereditary right and the
      doctrine of passive obedience had taken such a hold on the minds of the
      Tories, that, if James had been restored to power on any conditions, their
      attachment to him would in all probability have revived, as the
      indignation which recent oppression had produced faded from their minds.
      It had become indispensable to have a sovereign whose title to his throne
      was strictly bound up with the title of the nation to its liberties. In
      the compact between the Prince of Orange and the Convention, there was one
      most important article which, though not expressed, was perfectly
      understood by both parties, and for the performance of which the country
      had securities far better than all the engagements that Charles the First
      or Ferdinand the Seventh ever took in the day of their weakness, and broke
      in the day of their power. The article to which we allude was this, that
      William would in all things conform himself to what should appear to be
      the fixed and deliberate sense of his Parliament. The security for the
      performance was this, that he had no claim to the throne except the choice
      of Parliament, and no means of maintaining himself on the throne but the
      support of Parliament. All the great and inestimable reforms which
      speedily followed the Revolution were implied in those simple words; &ldquo;The
      Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, assembled at Westminster, do
      resolve that William and Mary, Prince and Princess of Orange, be, and be
      declared King and Queen of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And what were the reforms of which we speak? We <span class="pagenum">321</span><a
      name="link321" id="link321"></a>will shortly recount some which we think
      the most important; and we will then leave our readers to judge whether
      those who consider the Revolution as a mere change of dynasty, beneficial
      to a few aristocrats, but useless to the body of the people, or those who
      consider it as a happy era in the history of the British nation and of the
      human species, have judged more correctly of its nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foremost in the list of the benefits which our country owes to the
      Revolution we place the Toleration Act. It is true that this measure fell
      short of the wishes of the leading Whigs. It is true also that, where
      Catholics were concerned, even the most enlightened of the leading Whigs
      held opinions by no means so liberal as those which are happily common at
      the present day. Those distinguished statesmen did however make a noble,
      and, in some respects, a successful straggle for the rights of conscience.
      Their wish was to bring the great body of the Protestant Dissenters within
      the pale of the Church by judicious alterations in the Liturgy and the
      Articles, and to grant to those who still remained without that pale the
      most ample toleration. They framed a plan of comprehension which would
      have satisfied a great majority of the seceders; and they proposed the
      complete abolition of that absurd and odious test which, after having
      been, during a century and a half, a scandal to the pious and a
      laughing-stock to the profane, was at length removed in our own time. The
      immense power of the Clergy and of the Tory gentry frustrated these
      excellent designs. The Whigs, however, did much. They succeeded in
      obtaining a law in the provisions of which a philosopher will doubtless
      find much to condemn, but which had the practical effect of enabling
      almost every Protestant Nonconformist <span class="pagenum">322</span><a
      name="link322" id="link322"></a>to follow the dictates of his own
      conscience without molestation. Scarcely a law in the statute-book is
      theoretically more objectionable than the Toleration Act. But we question
      whether in the whole of that vast mass of legislation, from the Great
      Charter downwards, there be a single law which has so much diminished the
      sum of human suffering, which has done so much to allay bad passions,
      which has put an end to so much petty tyranny and vexation, which has
      brought gladness, peace, and a sense of security to so many private
      dwellings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second of those great reforms which the Revolution produced was the
      final establishment of the Presbyterian Kirk in Scotland. We shall not now
      inquire whether the Episcopal or the Calvinistic form of Church government
      be more agreeable to primitive practice. Far be it from us to disturb with
      our doubts the repose of any Oxonian Bachelor of Divinity who conceives
      that the English prelates with their baronies and palaces, their purple
      and their fine linen, their mitred carriages and their sumptuous tables,
      are the true successors of those ancient bishops who lived by catching
      fish and mending tents. We say only that the Scotch, doubtless from their
      own inveterate stupidity and malice, were not Episcopalians; that they
      could not be made Episcopalians; that the whole power of government had
      been in vain employed for the purpose of converting them; that the fullest
      instruction on the mysterious questions of the Apostolical succession and
      the imposition of hands had been imparted by the very logical process of
      putting the legs of the students into wooden boots, and driving two or
      more wedges between their knees; that a course of divinity lectures, of
      the most edifying kind, had been given in <span class="pagenum">323</span><a
      name="link323" id="link323"></a>the grass-market of Edinburgh; yet that,
      in spite of all the exertions of those great theological professors,
      Lauderdale and Dundee, the Covenanters were as obstinate as ever. To the
      contest between the Scotch nation and the Anglican Church are to be
      ascribed near thirty years of the most frightful misgovernment ever seen
      in any part of Great Britain. If the Revolution had produced no other
      effect than that of freeing the Scotch from the yoke of an establishment
      which they detested, and giving them one to which they were attached, it
      would have been one of the happiest events in our history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third great benefit which the country derived from the Revolution was
      the alteration in the mode of granting the supplies. It had been the
      practice to settle on every prince, at the commencement of his reign, the
      produce of certain taxes which, it was supposed, would yield a sum
      sufficient to defray the ordinary expenses of government. The distribution
      of the revenue was left wholly to the sovereign. He might be forced by a
      war, or by his own profusion, to ask for an extraordinary grant. But, if
      his policy were economical and pacific, he might reign many years without
      once being under the necessity of summoning his Parliament, or of taking
      their advice when he had summoned them. This was not all. The natural
      tendency of every society in which property enjoys tolerable security is
      to increase in wealth. With the national wealth, the produce of the
      customs, of the excise, and of the post-office, would of course increase;
      and thus it might well happen that taxes which, at the beginning of a long
      reign, were barely sufficient to support a frugal government in time of
      peace, might, before the end of that reign, enable the <span
      class="pagenum">324</span><a name="link324" id="link324"></a>sovereign to
      imitate the extravagance of Nero or Heliogabalus, to raise great armies,
      to carry on expensive wars. Something of this sort had actually happened
      under Charles the Second, though his reign, reckoned from the Restoration,
      lasted only twenty-five years. His first Parliament settled on him taxes
      estimated to produce twelve hundred thousand pounds a year. This they
      thought sufficient, as they allowed nothing for a standing army in time of
      peace. At the time of Charles&rsquo;s death, the annual produce of these taxes
      considerably exceeded a million and a half; and the King who, during the
      years which immediately followed his accession, was perpetually in
      distress, and perpetually asking his Parliaments for money, was at last
      able to keep a body of regular troops without any assistance from the
      House of Commons. If his reign had been as long as that of George the
      Third, he would probably, before the close of it, have been in the annual
      receipt of several millions over and above what the ordinary expenses of
      civil government required; and of those millions he would have been as
      absolutely master as the King now is of the sum allotted for his
      privy-purse. He might have spent them in luxury, in corruption, in paying
      troops to overawe his people, or in carrying into effect wild schemes of
      foreign conquest. The authors of the Revolution applied a remedy to this
      great abuse. They settled on the King, not the fluctuating produce of
      certain fixed taxes, but a fixed sum sufficient for the support of his own
      royal state. They established it as a rule that all the expenses of the
      army, the navy, and the ordnance, should be brought annually under the
      review of the House of Commons, and that every sum voted should be applied
      to the service specified in the vote. The direct effect of this <span
      class="pagenum">325</span><a name="link325" id="link325"></a>change was
      important. The indirect effect has been more important still. From that
      time the House of Commons has been really the paramount power in the
      state. It has, in truth, appointed and removed ministers, declared war,
      and concluded peace. No combination of the King and the Lords has ever
      been able to effect any thing against the Lower House, backed by its
      constituents. Three or four times, indeed, the sovereign has been able to
      break the force of an opposition by dissolving the Parliament. But if that
      experiment should fail, if the people should be of the same mind with
      their representatives, he would clearly have no course left but to yield,
      to abdicate, or to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next great blessing which we owe to the Revolution is the purification
      of the administration of justice in political cases. Of the importance of
      this change no person can judge who is not well acquainted with the
      earlier volumes of the State Trials. These volumes are, we do not hesitate
      to say, the most frightful record of baseness and depravity that is extant
      in the world. Our hatred is altogether turned away from the crimes and the
      criminals, and directed against the law and its ministers. We see
      villanies as black as ever were imputed to any prisoner at any bar daily
      committed on the bench and in the jury-box. The worst of the bad acts
      which brought discredit on the old Parliaments of France, the condemnation
      of Lally, for example, or even that of Calas, may seem praiseworthy when
      compared with the atrocities which follow each other in endless succession
      as we turn over that huge chronicle of the shame of England. The
      magistrates of Paris and Toulouse were blinded by prejudice, passion, or
      bigotry. But the abandoned judges of our own country committed murder with
      their eyes open. <span class="pagenum">326</span><a name="link326"
       id="link326"></a>The cause of this is plain. In France there was no
      constitutional opposition. If a man held language offensive to the
      government, he was at once sent to the Bastile or to Vincennes. But in
      England, at least after the days of the Long Parliament, the King could
      not, by a mere act of his prerogative, rid himself of a troublesome
      politician. He was forced to remove those who thwarted him by means of
      perjured witnesses, packed juries, and corrupt, hard-hearted, browbeating
      judges. The Opposition naturally retaliated whenever they had the upper
      hand. Every time that the power passed from one party to the other, there
      was a proscription and a massacre, thinly disguised under the forms of
      judicial procedure. The tribunals ought to be sacred places of refuge,
      where, in all the vicissitudes of public affairs, the innocent of all
      parties may find shelter. They were, before the Revolution, an unclean
      public shambles, to which each party in its turn dragged its opponents,
      and where each found the same venal and ferocious butchers waiting for its
      custom. Papist or Protestant, Tory or Whig, Priest or Alderman, all was
      one to those greedy and savage natures, provided only there was money to
      earn, and blood to shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, these worthless judges soon created around them, as was
      natural, a breed of informers more wicked, if possible, than themselves.
      The trial by jury afforded little or no protection to the innocent. The
      juries were nominated by the sheriffs. The sheriffs were in most parts of
      England nominated by the Crown. In London, the great scene of political
      contention, those officers were chosen by the people. The fiercest
      parliamentary election of our time will give but a faint notion of the
      storm which raged in the city on <span class="pagenum">327</span><a
      name="link327" id="link327"></a>the day when two interested parties, each
      bearing its badge, met to select the men in whose hands were to be the
      issues of life and death for the coming year. On that day, nobles of the
      highest descent did not think it beneath them to canvass and marshal the
      livery, to head the procession, and to watch the poll. On that day, the
      great chiefs of parties waited in an agony of suspense for the messenger
      who was to bring from Guildhall the news whether their lives and estates
      were, for the next twelve months, to be at the mercy of a friend or of a
      foe. In 1681, Whig sheriffs were chosen; and Shaftesbury defied the whole
      power of the government. In 1682 the sheriffs were Tories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaftesbury fled to Holland. The other chiefs of the party broke up their
      councils, and retired in haste to their country-seats. Sydney on the
      scaffold told those sheriffs that his blood was on their heads. Neither of
      them could deny the charge; and one of them wept with shame and remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus every man who then meddled with public affairs, took his life in his
      hand. The consequence was that men of gentle natures stood aloof from
      contests in which they could not engage without hazarding their own necks
      and the fortunes of their children. This was the course adopted by Sir
      William Temple, by Evelyn, and by many other men who were, in every
      respect, admirably qualified to serve the State. On the other hand, those
      resolute and enterprising men who put their heads and lands to hazard in
      the game of politics naturally acquired, from the habit of playing for so
      deep a stake, a reckless and desperate turn of mind. It was, we seriously
      believe, as safe to be a highwayman as to be a distinguished leader of
      Opposition. This may serve to explain, and in some degree <span
      class="pagenum">328</span><a name="link328" id="link328"></a>to excuse,
      the violence with which the factions of that age are justly reproached.
      They were fighting, not merely for office, but for life. It they reposed
      for a moment from the work of agitation, if they suffered the public
      excitement to flag, they were lost men. Hume, in describing this state of
      things, has employed an image which seems hardly to suit the general
      simplicity of his style, but which is by no means too strong for the
      occasion. &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;the two parties actuated by mutual rage, but
      cooped up within the narrow limits of the law, levelled with poisoned
      daggers the most deadly blows against each other&rsquo;s breast, and buried in
      their factious divisions all regard to truth, honour, and humanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From this terrible evil the Revolution set us free. The law which secured
      to the judges them seats during life or good behaviour did something. The
      law subsequently passed for regulating trials in cases of treason did much
      more. The provisions of that law show, indeed, very little legislative
      skill. It is not framed on the principle of securing the innocent, but on
      the principle of giving a great chance of escape to the accused, whether
      innocent or guilty. This, however, is decidedly a fault on the right side.
      The evil produced by the occasional escape of a bad citizen is not to be
      compared with the evils of that Reign of Terror, for such it was, which
      preceded the Revolution. Since the passing of this law scarcely one single
      person has suffered death in England as a traitor, who had not been
      convicted on overwhelming evidence, to the satisfaction of all parties, of
      the highest crime against the State. Attempts have been made in times of
      great excitement, to bring in persons guilty of high treason for acts
      which, though sometimes highly blamable, did <span class="pagenum">329</span><a
      name="link329" id="link329"></a>not necessarily imply a design falling
      within the legal definition of treason. All those attempts have failed.
      During a hundred and forty years no statesman, while engaged in
      constitutional opposition to a government, has had the axe before his
      eyes. The smallest minorities, struggling against the most powerful
      majorities, in the most agitated times, have felt themselves perfectly
      secure. Pulteney and Fox were the two most distinguished leaders of
      Opposition since the Revolution. Both were personally obnoxious to the
      Court. But the utmost harm that the utmost anger of the Court could do to
      them was to strike off the &ldquo;Right Honourable&rdquo; from before their names.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of all the reforms produced by the Revolution, perhaps the most
      important was the full establishment of the liberty of unlicensed
      printing. The Censorship which, under some form or other, had existed,
      with rare and short intermissions, under every government, monarchical or
      republican, from the time of Henry the Eighth downwards, expired, and has
      never since been renewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are aware that the great improvements which we have recapitulated were,
      in many respects, imperfectly and unskilfully executed. The authors of
      those improvements sometimes, while they removed or mitigated a great
      practical evil, continued to recognise the erroneous principle from which
      that evil had sprung. Sometimes when they had adopted a sound principle,
      they shrank from following it to all the conclusions to which it would
      have led them. Sometimes they failed to perceive that the remedies which
      they applied to one disease of the State were certain to generate another
      disease, and to render another remedy necessary. Their knowledge was
      inferior to ours: nor were they <span class="pagenum">330</span><a
      name="link330" id="link330"></a>always able to act up to their knowledge.
      The pressure of circumstances, the necessity of compromising differences
      of opinion, the power and violence of the party which was altogether
      hostile to the new settlement, must be taken into the account. When these
      things are fairly weighed, there will, we think, be little difference of
      opinion among liberal and right-minded men as to the real value of what
      the great events of 1688 did for this country.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have recounted what appear to us the most important of those changes
      which the Revolution produced in our laws. The changes which it produced
      in our laws, however, were not more important than the change which it
      indirectly produced in the public mind. The Whig party had during seventy
      years, an almost uninterrupted possession of power. It had always been the
      fundamental doctrine of that party, that power is a trust for the people;
      that it is given to magistrates, not for their own, but for the public
      advantage; that, where it is abused by magistrates, even by the highest of
      all, it may lawfully be withdrawn. It is perfectly true, that the Whigs
      were not more exempt than other men from the vices and infirmities of our
      nature, and that, when they had power, they sometimes abused it. But still
      they stood firm to their theory. That theory was the badge of their party.
      It was something more. It was the foundation on which rested the power of
      the houses of Nassau and Brunswick. Thus, there was a government
      interested in propagating a class of opinions which most governments are
      interested in discouraging, a government which looked with complacency on
      all speculations favourable to public liberty, and with extreme aversion
      on all speculations <span class="pagenum">331</span><a name="link331"
       id="link331"></a>favourable to arbitrary power. There was a King who
      decidedly preferred a republican to a believer in the divine right of
      kings; who considered every attempt to exalt his prerogative as an attack
      on his title; and who reserved all his favours for those who declaimed on
      the natural equality of men, and the popular origin of government. This
      was the state of things from the Revolution till the death of George the
      Second. The effect was what might have been expected. Even in that
      profession which has generally been most disposed to magnify the
      prerogative, a great change took place. Bishopric after bishopric and
      deanry after deanry were bestowed on Whigs and Latitudinarians. The
      consequence was that Whiggism and Latitudinarianism were professed by the
      ablest and most aspiring churchmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hume complained bitterly of this at the close of his history. &ldquo;The Whig
      party,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;for a course of near seventy years, has almost without
      interruption enjoyed the whole authority of government, and no honours or
      offices could be obtained but by their countenance and protection. But
      this event, which in some particulars has been advantageous to the state,
      has proved destructive to the truth of history, and has established many
      gross falsehoods, which it is unaccountable how any civilised nation could
      have embraced, with regard to its domestic occurrences. Compositions the
      most despicable, both for style and matter,&rdquo;&mdash;in a note he instances
      the writings of Locke, Sydney, Hoadley, and Rapin,&mdash;&ldquo;have been
      extolled and propagated and read as if they had equalled the most
      celebrated remains of antiquity. And forgetting that a regard to liberty,
      though a laudable passion, ought commonly to be subservient <span
      class="pagenum">332</span><a name="link332" id="link332"></a>to a
      reverence for established government, the prevailing faction has
      celebrated only the partisans of the former.&rdquo; We will not here enter into
      an argument about the merit of Rapin&rsquo;s History or Locke&rsquo;s political
      speculations. We call Hume merely as evidence to a fact well known to all
      reading men, that the literature patronised by the English Court and the
      English ministry, during the first half of the eighteenth century, was of
      that kind which courtiers and ministers generally do all in their power to
      discountenance, and tended to inspire zeal for the liberties of the people
      rather than respect for the authority of the government.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still a very strong Tory party in England. But that party was in
      opposition. Many of its members still held the doctrine of passive
      obedience. But they did not admit that the existing dynasty had any claim
      to such obedience. They condemned resistance. But by resistance they meant
      the keeping out of James the Third, and not the turning out of George the
      Second. No Radical of our times could grumble more at the expenses of the
      royal household, could exert himself more strenuously to reduce the
      military establishment, could oppose with more earnestness every
      proposition for arming the executive with extraordinary powers, or could
      pour more unmitigated abuse on placemen and courtiers If a writer were
      now, in a massive Dictionary, to define a Pensioner as a traitor and a
      slave, the Excise as a hateful tax, the Commissioners of the Excise as
      wretches, if he were to write a satire full of reflections on men who
      receive &ldquo;the price of boroughs and of souls,&rdquo; who &ldquo;explain their country&rsquo;s
      dear-bought rights away,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">333</span><a name="link333"
       id="link333"></a>or <br /><br /><span class="indent25">"whom pensions can
      incite <br /><span class="indent15">To vote a patriot black, a courtier
      white,&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      we should set him down for something more democratic than a Whig. Yet this
      was the language which Johnson, the most bigoted of Tories and High
      Churchmen, held under the administration of Walpole and Pelham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus doctrines favourable to public liberty were inculcated alike by those
      who were in power and by those who were in opposition. It was by means of
      these doctrines alone that the former could prove that they had a King <i>de
      jure</i>. The servile theories of the latter did not prevent them from
      offering every molestation to one whom they considered as merely a King <i>de
      facto</i>. The attachment of one party to the House of Hanover, of the
      other to that of Stuart, induced both to talk a language much more
      favourable to popular rights than to monarchical power. What took place at
      the first representation of Cato is no bad illustration of the way in
      which the two great sections of the community almost invariably acted. A
      play, the whole merit of which consists in its stately rhetoric, a
      rhetoric sometimes not unworthy of Lucan, about hating tyrants and dying
      for freedom, is brought on the stage in a time of great political
      excitement. Both parties crowd to the theatre. Each affects to consider
      every line as a compliment to itself, and an attack on its opponents. The
      curtain falls amidst an unanimous roar of applause. The Whigs of the Kit
      Cat embrace the author, and assure him that he has rendered an inestimable
      service to liberty. The Tory secretary of state presents a purse to the
      chief actor for defending the cause of liberty so well. The history of
      that night was, in miniature, the history of two generations. <span
      class="pagenum">334</span><a name="link334" id="link334"></a>We well know
      how much sophistry there was in the reasonings, and how much exaggeration
      in the declamations of both parties. But when we compare the state in
      which political science was at the close of the reign of George the Second
      with the state in which it had been when James the Second came to the
      throne, it is impossible not to admit that a prodigious improvement had
      taken place. We are no admirers of the political doctrines laid down in
      Blackstone&rsquo;s Commentaries. But if we consider that those Commentaries were
      read with great applause in the very schools where, seventy or eighty
      years before, books had been publicly burned by order of the University of
      Oxford for containing the damnable doctrine that the English monarchy is
      limited and mixed, we cannot deny that a salutary change had taken place.
      &ldquo;The Jesuits,&rdquo; says Pascal, in the last of his incomparable letters, &ldquo;have
      obtained a Papal decree, condemning Galileo&rsquo;s doctrine about the motion of
      the earth. It is all in vain. If the world is really turning round, all
      mankind together will not be able to keep it from turning, or to keep
      themselves from turning with it.&rdquo; The decrees of Oxford were as
      ineffectual to stay the great moral and political revolution as those of
      the Vatican to stay the motion of our globe. That learned University found
      itself not only unable to keep the mass from moving, but unable to keep
      itself from moving along with the mass. Nor was the effect of the
      discussions and speculations of that period confined to our own country.
      While the Jacobite party was in the last dotage and weakness of its
      paralytic old age, the political philosophy of England began to produce a
      mighty effect on France, and, through France, on Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here another vast field opens itself before us. But <span class="pagenum">335</span><a
      name="link335" id="link335"></a>we must resolutely turn away from it. We
      will conclude by advising all our readers to study Sir James Mackintosh&rsquo;s
      valuable Fragment, and by expressing our hope that they will soon be able
      to study it without those accompaniments which have hitherto impeded its
      circulation.

      class="pagenum">336</span><a name="link336" id="link336"></a>return our
      hearty thanks to Mr. Montagu for this truly valuable work. From the
      opinions which he expresses as a biographer we often dissent. But about
      his merit as a collector of the materials out of which opinions are
      formed, there can be no dispute; and we readily acknowledge that we are in
      a great measure indebted to his minute and accurate researches for the
      means of refuting what we cannot but consider as his errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The labour which has been bestowed on this volume has been a labour of
      love. The writer is evidently enamoured of the subject. It fills his
      heart. It constantly overflows from his lips and his pen. Those who are
      acquainted with the Courts in which Mr. Montagu practises with so much
      ability and success well know how often he enlivens the discussion of a
      point of law by citing some weighty aphorism, or some brilliant
      illustration, from the <i>De Augmentis</i> or the <i>Novum Organum</i>.
      The Life before us doubtless owes much of its value to the honest and
      generous enthusiasm of the writer. This feeling has stimulated his
      activity, has sustained his perseverance, has called forth all his
      ingenuity and eloquence: but, on the other

     (1) <i>The Works of Francis Bacon, Lord Chancellor of England.

     London: 1825-1834
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">337</span><a name="link337" id="link337"></a>hand,
      we must frankly say that it has, to a great extent, perverted his
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are by no means without sympathy for Mr. Montagu even in what we
      consider as his weakness. There is scarcely any delusion which has a
      better claim to be indulgently treated than that under the influence of
      which a man ascribes every moral excellence to those who have left
      imperishable monuments of their genius. The causes of this error lie deep
      in the inmost recesses of human nature. We are all inclined to judge of
      others as we find them. Our estimate of a character always depends much on
      the manner in which that character affects our own interests and passions.
      We find it difficult to think well of those by whom we are thwarted or
      depressed; and we are ready to admit every excuse for the vices of those
      who are useful or agreeable to us. This is, we believe, one of those
      illusions to which the whole human race is subject, ana which experience
      and reflection can only partially remove. It is, in the phraseology of
      Bacon, one of the <i>idolatribus</i>. Hence it is that the moral character
      of a man eminent in letters or in the fine arts is treated, often by
      contemporaries, almost always by posterity, with extraordinary tenderness.
      The world derives pleasure and advantage from the performances of such a
      man. The number of those who suffer by his personal vices is small, even
      in his own time, when compared with the number of those to whom his
      talents are a source of gratification. In a few years all those whom he
      has injured disappear. But his works remain, and are a source of delight
      to millions. The genius of Sallust is still with us. But the Numidians
      whom he plundered, and the unfortunate husbands who caught him in their
      houses at unseasonable hours, are forgotten. <span class="pagenum">338</span><a
      name="link338" id="link338"></a>We suffer ourselves to be delighted by the
      keenness of Clarendon&rsquo;s observation, and by the sober majesty of his
      style, till we forget the oppressor and the bigot in the historian.
      Falstaff and Tom Jones have survived the gamekeepers whom Shakspeare
      cudgelled and the landladies whom Fielding bilked. A great writer is the
      friend and benefactor of his readers; and they cannot but judge of him
      under the deluding influence of friendship and gratitude. We all know how
      unwilling we are to admit the truth of any disgraceful story about a
      person whose society we like, and from whom we have received favours: how
      long we struggle against evidence, how fondly, when the facts cannot be
      disputed, we cling to the hope that there may be some explanation or some
      extenuating circumstance with which we are unacquainted. Just such is the
      feeling which a man of liberal education naturally entertains towards the
      great minds of former ages. The debt which he owes to them is
      incalculable. They have guided him to truth. They have filled his mind
      with noble and graceful images. They have stood by him in all
      vicissitudes, comforters in sorrow, nurses in sickness, companions in
      solitude. These friendships are exposed to no danger from the occurrences
      by which other attachments are weakened or dissolved. Time glides on;
      fortune is inconstant; tempers are soured; bonds which seemed indissoluble
      are daily sundered by interest, by emulation, or by caprice. But no such
      cause can affect the silent converse which we hold with the highest of
      human intellects. That placid intercourse is disturbed by no jealousies or
      resentments. These are the old friends who are never seen with new faces,
      who are the same in wealth and in poverty, in glory and in obscurity. With
      the dead there is no rivalry. In the <span class="pagenum">339</span><a
      name="link339" id="link339"></a>dead there is no change. Plato is never
      sullen. Cervantes is never petulant. Demosthenes never comes unseasonably.
      Dante never stays too long. No difference of political opinion can
      alienate Cicero. No heresy can excite the horror of Bossuet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing, then, can be more natural than that a person endowed with
      sensibility and imagination should entertain a respectful and affectionate
      feeling towards those great men with whose minds he holds daily communion.
      Yet nothing can be more certain than that such men have not always
      deserved to be regarded with respect or affection. Some writers, whose
      works will continue to instruct and delight mankind to the remotest ages,
      have been placed in such situations that their actions and motives are as
      well known to us as the actions and motives of one human being can be
      known to another; and unhappily their conduct has not always been such as
      an impartial judge can contemplate with approbation. But the fanaticism of
      the devout worshipper of genius is proof against all evidence and all
      argument. The character of his idol is matter of faith; and the province
      of faith is not to be invaded by reason. He maintains his superstition
      with a credulity as boundless, and a zeal as unscrupulous, as can be found
      in the most ardent partisans of religious or political factions. The most
      decisive proofs are rejected; the plainest rules of morality are explained
      away; extensive and important portions of history are completely
      distorted. The enthusiast misrepresents facts with all the effrontery of
      an advocate, and confounds right and wrong with all the dexterity of a
      Jesuit; and all this only in order that some man who has been in his grave
      during many ages may have a fairer character than he deserves. <span
      class="pagenum">340</span><a name="link340" id="link340"></a>Middleton&rsquo;s
      Life of Cicero is a striking instance of the influence of this sort of
      partiality. Never was there a character which it was easier to read than
      that of Cicero. Never was there a mind keener or more critical than that
      of Middleton. Had the biographer brought to the examination of his
      favourite statesman&rsquo;s conduct but a very small part of the acuteness and
      severity which he displayed when he was engaged in investigating the high
      pretensions of Epiphanius and Justin Martyr, he could not have failed to
      produce a most valuable history of a most interesting portion of time. But
      this most ingenious and learned man, though, <br /><br /><span
      class="indent25">"So wary held and wise <br /><span class="indent20">That,
      as &rsquo;twas said, he scarce received <br /><span class="indent20">For gospel
      what the church believed,&rdquo; </span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      had a superstition of his own. The great Iconoclast was himself an
      idolater. The great <i>Avvocato del Diavolo</i>, while he disputed, with
      no small ability, the claims of Cyprian and Athanasius to a place in the
      Calendar, was himself composing a lying legend in honour of St. Tully. He
      was holding up as a model of every virtue a man whose talents and
      acquirements, indeed, can never be too highly extolled, and who was by no
      means destitute of amiable qualities, but whose whole soul was under the
      dominion of a girlish vanity and a craven fear. Actions for which Cicero
      himself, the most eloquent and skilful of advocates, could contrive no
      excuse, actions which in his confidential correspondence he mentioned with
      remorse and shame, are represented by his biographer as wise, virtuous,
      heroic. The whole history of that great revolution which overthrew the
      Roman aristocracy, the whole state of parties, the character of every
      public man, is <span class="pagenum">341</span><a name="link341"
       id="link341"></a>elaborately misrepresented, in order to make out
      something which may look like a defence of one most eloquent and
      accomplished trimmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The volume before us reminds us now and then of the Life of Cicero. But
      there is this marked difference. Dr. Middleton evidently had an uneasy
      consciousness of the weakness of his cause, and therefore resorted to the
      most disingenuous shifts, to unpardonable distortions and suppression of
      facts. Mr. Montagu&rsquo;s faith is sincere and implicit. He practises no
      trickery. He conceals nothing. He puts the facts before us in the full
      confidence that they will produce on our minds the effect which they have
      produced on his own. It is not till he comes to reason from facts to
      motives that his partiality shows itself; and then he leaves Middleton
      himself far behind. His work proceeds on the assumption that Bacon was an
      eminently virtuous man. From the tree Mr. Montagu judges of the fruit. He
      is forced to relate many actions which, if any man but Bacon had committed
      them, nobody would have dreamed of defending, actions which are readily
      and completely explained by supposing Bacon to have been a man whose
      principles were not strict, and whose spirit was not high, actions which
      can be explained in no other way without resorting to some grotesque
      hypothesis for which there is not a tittle of evidence. But any hypothesis
      is, in Mr. Montagu&rsquo;s opinion, more probable than that his hero should ever
      have done any thing very wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mode of defending Bacon seems to us by no means Baconian. To take a
      man&rsquo;s character for granted, and then from his character to infer the
      moral quality of all his actions, is surely a process the very reverse of
      that which is recommended in the <i>Novum <span class="pagenum">342</span><a
      name="link342" id="link342"></a>Organum</i>. Nothing, we are sure, could
      have led Mr. Montagu to depart so far from his master&rsquo;s precepts, except
      zeal for his master&rsquo;s honour. We shall follow a different course. We shall
      attempt, with the valuable assistance which Mr. Montagu has afforded us,
      to frame such an account of Bacon&rsquo;s life as may enable our readers
      correctly to estimate his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hardly necessary to say that Francis Bacon was the son of Sir
      Nicholas Bacon, who held the great seal of England during the first twenty
      years of the reign of Elizabeth. The fame of the father has been thrown
      into shade by that of the son. But Sir Nicholas was no ordinary man. He
      belonged to a set of men whom it is easier to describe collectively than
      separately, whose minds were formed by one system of discipline, who
      belonged to one rank in society, to one university, to one party, to one
      sect, to one administration, and who resembled each other so much in
      talents, in opinions, in habits, in fortunes, that one character, we had
      almost said one life, may, to a considerable extent, serve for them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were the first generation of statesmen by profession that England
      produced. Before their time the division of labour had, in this respect,
      been very imperfect. Those who had directed public affairs had been, with
      few exceptions, warriors or priests; warriors whose rule courage was
      neither guided by science nor softened by humanity, priests whose learning
      and abilities were habitually devoted to the defence of tyranny and
      imposture. The Hotspurs, the Nevilles, the Cliffords, rough, illiterate,
      and unreflecting, brought to the council-board the fierce and imperious
      disposition which they had acquired amidst the tumult of predatory war, or
      in the gloomy repose of the garrisoned and moated <span class="pagenum">343</span><a
      name="link343" id="link343"></a>castle. On the other side was the calm and
      subtle prelate, versed in all that was then considered as learning,
      trained in the Schools to manage words, and in the confessional to manage
      hearts, seldom superstitious, but skilful in practising on the
      superstition of others, false, as it was natural that a man should be
      whose profession imposed on all who were not saints the necessity of being
      hypocrites, selfish, as it was natural that a man should be who could form
      no domestic ties and cherish no hope of legitimate posterity, more
      attached to his order than to his country, and guiding the politics of
      England with a constant side-glance at Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the increase of wealth, the progress of knowledge, and the reformation
      of religion produced a great change. The nobles ceased to be military
      chieftains; the priests ceased to possess a monopoly of learning; and a
      new and remarkable species of politicians appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      These men came from neither of the classes which had, till then, almost
      exclusively furnished ministers of state. They were all laymen; yet they
      were all men of learning; and they were all men of peace. They were not
      members of the aristocracy. They inherited no titles, no large domains, no
      armies of retainers, no fortified castles. Yet they were not low men, such
      as those whom princes, jealous of the power of a nobility, have sometimes
      raised from forges and cobblers&rsquo; stalls to the highest situations. They
      were all gentlemen by birth. They had all received a liberal education. It
      is a remarkable fact that they were all members of the same university.
      The two great national seats of learning had even then acquired the
      characters which they still retain. In intellectual activity, and in
      readiness to admit improvements, the superiority was then, as it has ever
      since been, on the side of the less ancient <span class="pagenum">344</span><a
      name="link344" id="link344"></a>and splendid institution. Cambridge had
      the honour of educating those celebrated Protestant Bishops whom Oxford
      had the honour of burning; and at Cambridge were formed the minds of all
      those statesmen to whom chiefly is to be attributed the secure
      establishment of the reformed religion in the north of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The statesmen of whom we speak passed their youth surrounded by the
      incessant din of theological controversy. Opinions were still in a state
      of chaotic anarchy, intermingling, separating, advancing, receding.
      Sometimes the stubborn bigotry of the Conservatives seemed likely to
      prevail. Then the impetuous onset of the Reformers for a moment carried
      all before it. Then again the resisting mass made a desperate stand,
      arrested the movement, and forced it slowly back. The vacillation which at
      that time appeared in English legislation, and which it has been the
      fashion to attribute to the caprice and to the power of one or two
      individuals, was truly a national vacillation. It was not only in the mind
      of Henry that the new theology obtained the ascendant one day, and that
      the lessons of the nurse and of the priest regained their influence on the
      morrow. It was not only in the House of Tudor that the husband was
      exasperated by the opposition of the wife, that the son dissented from the
      opinions of the father, that the brother persecuted the sister, that one
      faster persecuted another. The principles of Conservation and Reform
      carried on their warfare in every part of society, in every congregation,
      in every school of learning, round the hearth of every private family, in
      the recesses of every reflecting mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the midst of this ferment that the minds of the persons whom we
      are describing were developed. They were born Reformers. They belonged by
      nature <span class="pagenum">345</span><a name="link345" id="link345"></a>to
      that order of men who always form the front ranks in the great
      intellectual progress. They were, therefore, one and all, Protestants. In
      religious matters, however, though there is no reason to doubt that they
      were sincere, they were by no means zealous. None of them chose to run the
      smallest personal risk during the reign of Mary. None of them favoured the
      unhappy attempt of Northumberland in favour of his daughter-in-law. None
      of them shared in the desperate councils of Wyatt. They contrived to have
      business on the Continent; or, if they staid in England, they heard mass
      and kept Lent with great decorum. When those dark and perilous years had
      gone by, and when the crown had descended to a new sovereign, they took
      the lead in the reformation of the Church. But they proceeded, not with
      the impetuosity of theologians, but with the calm determination of
      statesmen. They acted, not like men who considered the Romish worship as a
      system too offensive to God, and too destructive of souls to be tolerated
      for an hour, but like men who regarded the points in dispute among
      Christians as in themselves unimportant, and who were not restrained by
      any scruple of conscience from professing, as they had before professed,
      the Catholic faith of Mary, the Protestant faith of Edward, or any of the
      numerous intermediate combinations which the caprice of Henry and the
      servile policy of Cranmer had formed out of the doctrines of both the
      hostile parties. They took a deliberate view of the state of their own
      country and of the Continent: they satisfied themselves as to the leaning
      of the public mind; and they chose their side. They placed themselves at
      the head of the Protestants of Europe, and staked all their fame and
      fortunes on the success of their party. <span class="pagenum">346</span><a
      name="link346" id="link346"></a>It is needless to relate how dexterously,
      how resolutely, how gloriously they directed the polities of England
      during the eventful years which followed, how they succeeded in uniting
      their friends and separating their enemies, how they humbled the pride of
      Philip, how they backed the unconquerable spirit of Coligni, how they
      rescued Holland from tyranny, how they, founded the maritime greatness of
      their country, how they outwitted the artful politicians of Italy, and
      tamed the ferocious chieftains of Scotland. It is impossible to deny that
      they committed many acts which would justly bring on a statesman of our
      time censures of the most serious kind. But, when we consider the state of
      morality in their age, and the unscrupulous character of the adversaries
      against whom they had to contend, we are forced to admit that it is not
      without reason that their names are still held in veneration by their
      countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were, doubtless, many diversities in their intellectual and moral
      character. But there was a strong family likeness. The constitution of
      their minds was remarkably sound. No particular faculty was preeminently
      developed; but manly health and vigour were equally diffused through the
      whole. They were men of letters. Their minds were by nature and by
      exercise well fashioned for speculative pursuits. It was by circumstances,
      rather than by any strong bias of inclination, that they were led to take
      a prominent part in active life. In active life, however, no men could be
      more perfectly free from the faults of mere theorists and pedants. No men
      observed more accurately the signs of the times. No men had a greater
      practical acquaintance with human nature. Their policy was generally
      characterized <span class="pagenum">347</span><a name="link347"
       id="link347"></a>rather by vigilance, by moderation, and by firmness, than
      by invention, or by the spirit of enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke and wrote in a manner worthy of their excellent sense. Their
      eloquence was less copious and less ingenious, but far purer and more
      manly than that of the succeeding generation. It was the eloquence of men
      who had lived with the first translators of the Bible, and with the
      authors of the Book of Common Prayer. It was luminous, dignified, solid,
      and very slightly tainted with that affectation which deformed the style
      of the ablest men of the next age. If, as sometimes chanced, these
      politicians were under the necessity of taking a part in the theological
      controversies on which the dearest interests of kingdoms were then staked,
      they acquitted themselves as if their whole lives had been passed in the
      Schools and the Convocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in the temper of these celebrated men which secured
      them against the proverbial inconstancy both of the court and of the
      multitude. No intrigue, no combination of rivals, could deprive them of
      the confidence of their Sovereign. No parliament attacked their influence.
      No mob coupled their names with any odious grievance. Their power ended
      only with their lives. In this respect, their fate presents a most
      remarkable contrast to that of the enterprising and brilliant politicians
      of the preceding and of the succeeding generation. Burleigh was minister
      during forty years. Sir Nicholas Bacon held the great seal more than
      twenty years. Sir Walter Mildmay was Chancellor of the Exchequer
      twenty-three years. Sir Thomas Smith was Secretary of State eighteen
      years; Sir Francis Walsingham about as long. They all died in office, and
      in the enjoyment of public respect <span class="pagenum">348</span><a
      name="link348" id="link348"></a>and royal favour. Far different had been
      the fate of Wolsey, Cromwell, Norfolk, Somerset, and Northumberland. Far
      different also was the fate of Essex, of Raleigh, and of the still more
      illustrious man whose life we propose to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      The explanation of this circumstance is perhaps contained in the motto
      which Sir Nicholas Bacon inscribed over the entrance of his hall at
      Gorhambury, <i>Mediocria firma.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This maxim was constantly borne in mind by himself and his colleagues.
      They were more solicitous to lay the foundations of their power deep than
      to raise the structure to a conspicuous but insecure height. None of them
      aspired to be sole Minister. None of them provoked envy by an ostentatious
      display of wealth and influence. None of them affected to outshine the
      ancient aristocracy of the kingdom. They were free from that childish love
      of titles which characterized the successful courtiers of the generation
      which preceded them, and of that which followed them. Only one of those
      whom we have named was made a peer; and he was content with the lowest
      degree of the peerage. As to money, none of them could, in that age,
      justly be considered as rapacious. Some of them would, even in our time,
      deserve the praise of eminent disinterestedness. Their fidelity to the
      State was incorruptible. Their private morals were without stain. Their
      households were sober and well-governed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among these statesmen Sir Nicholas Bacon was generally considered as
      ranking next to Burleigh. He was called by Camden &ldquo;Saeris conciliis
      alterum columen,&rdquo; and by George Buchanan, <br /><br /><span class="indent25">"diu
      Britannici <br /><span class="indent20">Regni secundum columen.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">349</span><a name="link349" id="link349"></a>The
      second wife of Sir Nicholas and mother of Francis Bacon was Anne, one of
      the daughters of Sir Anthony Cooke, a man of distinguished learning who
      had been tutor to Edward the Sixth. Sir Anthony had paid considerable
      attention to the education of his daughters, and lived to see them all
      splendidly and happily married. Their classical acquirements made them
      conspicuous even among the women of fashion of that age. Katherine, who
      became Lady Killigrew, wrote Latin Hexameters and Pentameters which would
      appear with credit in the <i>Musae Etonenses</i>. Mildred, the wife of
      Lord Burleigh, was described by Roger Ascham as the best Greek scholar
      among the young women of England, Lady Jane Grey always excepted. Anne,
      the mother of Francis Bacon, was distinguished both as a linguist and as a
      theologian. She corresponded in Greek with Bishop Jewel, and translated
      his <i>Apologia</i> from the Latin, so correctly that neither he nor
      Archbishop Parker could suggest a single alteration. She also translated a
      series of sermons on fate and freewill from the Tuscan of Bernardo Ochino.
      This fact is the more curious, because Ochino was one of that small and
      audacious band of Italian reformers, anathematized alike by Wittenberg, by
      Geneva, by Zurich, and by Rome, from which the Socinian sect deduces its
      origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bacon was doubtless a lady of highly cultivated mind after the
      fashion of her age. But we must not suffer ourselves to be deluded into
      the belief that she and her sisters were more accomplished women than many
      who are now living. On this subject there is, we think, much
      misapprehension. We have often heard men who wish, as almost all men of
      sense wish, that women should be highly educated, speak with rapture of
      <span class="pagenum">350</span><a name="link350" id="link350"></a>the
      English ladies of the sixteenth century, and lament that they can find no
      modern damsel resembling those fair pupils of Ascham and Aylmer who
      compared, over their embroidery, the styles of Isocrates and Lysias, and
      who, while the horns were sounding and the dogs in full cry, sat in the
      lonely oriel, with eyes rivetted to that immortal page which tells how
      meekly and bravely the first great martyr of intellectual liberty took the
      cup from his weeping gaoler. But surely these complaints have very little
      foundation. We would by no means disparage the ladies of the sixteenth
      century or their pursuits. But we conceive that those who extol them at
      the expense of the women of our time forget one very obvious and very
      important circumstance. In the time of Henry the Eighth and Edward the
      Sixth, a person who did not read Greek and Latin could read nothing, or
      next to nothing. The Italian was the only modern language which possessed
      any thing that could be called a literature. All the valuable books then
      extant in all the vernacular dialects of Europe would hardly have filled a
      single shelf. England did not yet possess Shakspeare&rsquo;s plays and the Fairy
      Queen, nor France Montaigne&rsquo;s Essays, nor Spain Don Quixote. In looking
      round a well-furnished library, how many English or French books can we
      find which were extant when Lady Jane Grey and Queen Elizabeth received
      their education? Chaucer, Gower, Froissart, Comines, Rabelais, nearly
      complete the list. It was therefore absolutely necessary that a woman
      should be uneducated or classically educated. Indeed, without a knowledge
      of one of the ancient languages no person could then have any clear notion
      of what was passing in the political, the literary, or the religious
      world. The Latin was in the sixteenth century all <span class="pagenum">351</span><a
      name="link351" id="link351"></a>and more than all that the French was in
      the eighteenth. It was the language of courts as well as of the schools.
      It was the language of diplomacy; it was the language of theological and
      political controversy. Being a fixed language, while the living languages
      were in a state of fluctuation, and being universally known to the learned
      and the polite, it was employed by almost every writer who aspired to a
      wide and durable reputation. A person who was ignorant of it was shut out
      from all acquaintance, not merely with Cicero and Virgil, not merely with
      heavy treatises on canon-law and school-divinity, but with the most
      interesting memoirs, state papers, and pamphlets of his own time, nay even
      with the most admired poetry and the most popular squibs which appeared on
      the fleeting topics of the day, with Buchanan&rsquo;s complimentary verses, with
      Erasmus&rsquo;s dialogues, with Hutten&rsquo;s epistles.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is no longer the case. All political and religious controversy is now
      conducted in the modern languages. The ancient tongues are used only in
      comments on the ancient writers. The great productions of Athenian and
      Roman genius are indeed still what they were. But though their positive
      value is unchanged, their relative value, when compared with the whole
      mass of mental wealth possessed by mankind, has been constantly falling.
      They were the intellectual all of our ancestors. They are but a part of
      our treasures. Over what tragedy could Lady Jane Grey have wept, over what
      comedy could she have smiled, if the ancient dramatists had not been in
      her library? A modern reader can make shift without Odipus and Medea,
      while he possesses Othello and Hamlet. If he knows nothing of
      Pyrgopolynices and Thraso, he is familiar with Bobadil, and Bessus, and
      Pistol, and <span class="pagenum">352</span><a name="link352" id="link352"></a>Parolles.
      If he cannot enjoy the delicious irony of Plato, he may find some
      compensation in that of Pascal. If he is shut out from Nephelococcygia, he
      may take refuge in Lilliput. We are guilty, we hope, of no irreverence
      towards those great nations to which the human race owes art, science,
      taste, civil and intellectual freedom, when we say, that the stock
      bequeathed by them to us has been so carefully improved that the
      accumulated interest now exceeds the principal. We believe that the books
      which have been written in the languages of western Europe, during the
      last two hundred and fifty years,&mdash;translations from the ancient
      languages of course included,&mdash;are of greater value than all the
      books which at the beginning of that period were extant in the world. With
      the modern languages of Europe English women are at least as well
      acquainted as English men. When, therefore, we compare the acquirements of
      Lady Jane Grey with those of an accomplished young woman of our own time,
      we have no hesitation in awarding the superiority to the latter. We hope
      that our readers will pardon this digression. It is long; but it can
      hardly be called unseasonable, if it tends to convince them that they are
      mistaken in thinking that the great-great-grandmothers of their
      great-great-grandmothers were superior women to their sisters and their
      wives.

      Francis Bacon, the youngest son of Sir Nicholas, was born at York House,
      his father&rsquo;s residence in the Strand, on the twenty-second of January,
      1561. The health of Francis was very delicate; and to this circumstance
      may be partly attributed that gravity of carriage, and that love of
      sedentary pursuits, which distinguished him from other boys. Every body
      knows <span class="pagenum">353</span><a name="link353" id="link353"></a>how
      much his premature readiness of wit and sobriety of deportment amused the
      Queen, and how she used to call him her young Lord Keeper. We are told
      that, while still a mere child, he stole away from his playfellows to a
      vault in St. James&rsquo;s Fields, for the purpose of investigating the cause of
      a singular echo which he had observed there. It is certain that, at only
      twelve, he busied himself with very ingenious speculations on the art of
      legerdemain; a subject which, as Professor Dugald Stewart has most justly
      observed, merits much more attention from philosophers than it has ever
      received. These are trifles. But the eminence which Bacon afterwards
      attained makes them interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the thirteenth year of his age he was entered at Trinity College,
      Cambridge. That celebrated school of learning enjoyed the peculiar favour
      of the Lord Treasurer and the Lord Keeper, and acknowledged the advantages
      which it derived from their patronage in a public letter which bears date
      just a month after the admission of Francis Bacon. The master was
      Whitgift, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, a narrowminded, mean, and
      tyrannical priest, who gained power by servility and adulation, and
      employed it in persecuting both those who agreed with Calvin about Church
      Government, and those who differed from Calvin touching the doctrine of
      Reprobation. He was now in a chrysalis state, putting off the worm and
      putting on the dragon-fly, a kind of intermediate grub between sycophant
      and oppressor. He was indemnifying himself for the court which he found it
      expedient to pay to the Ministers by exercising much petty tyranny within
      his own college. It would be unjust, however, to deny him the praise of
      having rendered about this time one important service to letters. He stood
      up manfully <span class="pagenum">354</span><a name="link354" id="link354"></a>against
      those who wished to make Trinity College a mere appendage to Westminster
      School; and by this act, the only good act, as far as we remember, of his
      long public life, he saved the noblest place of education in England from
      the degrading fate of King&rsquo;s College and New College.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has often been said that Bacon, while still at College, planned that
      great intellectual revolution with which his name is inseparably
      connected. The evidence on this subject, however, is hardly sufficient to
      prove what is in itself so improbable as that any definite scheme of that
      kind should have been so early formed, even by so powerful and active a
      mind. But it is certain that, after a residence of three years at
      Cambridge, Bacon departed, carrying with him a profound contempt for the
      course of study pursued there, a fixed conviction that the system of
      academic education in England was radically vicious, a just scorn for the
      trifles on which the followers of Aristotle had wasted their powers, and
      no great reverence for Aristotle himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his sixteenth year he visited Paris, and resided there for some time,
      under the care of Sir Amias Paulet, Elizabeth&rsquo;s minister at the French
      court, and one of the ablest and most upright of the many valuable
      servants whom she employed. France was at that time in a deplorable state
      of agitation. The Huguenots and the Catholics were mustering all their
      force for the fiercest and most protracted of their many struggles; while
      the Prince, whose duty it was to protect and to restrain both, had by his
      vices and follies, degraded himself so deeply that he had no authority
      over either. Bacon, however, made a tour through several provinces, and
      appears to have passed some time at <span class="pagenum">355</span><a
      name="link355" id="link355"></a>Poitiers. We have abundant proof that
      during his stay on the Continent he did not neglect literary and
      scientific pursuits. But his attention seems to have been chiefly directed
      to statistics and diplomacy. It was at this time that he wrote those Notes
      on the State of Europe which are printed in his works. He studied the
      principles of the art of deciphering with great interest, and invented one
      cipher so ingenious that, many years later, he thought it deserving of a
      place in the <i>De Augmentis</i>. In February, 1580, while engaged in
      these pursuits, he received intelligence of the almost sudden death of his
      father, and instantly returned to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      His prospects were greatly overcast by this event. He was most desirous to
      obtain a provision which might enable him to devote himself to literature
      and politics. He applied to the Government; and it seems strange that he
      should have applied in vain. His wishes were moderate. His hereditary
      claims on the administration were great. He had himself been favourably
      noticed by the Queen. His uncle was Prime Minister. His own talents were
      such as any minister might have been eager to enlist in the public
      service. But his solicitations were unsuccessful. The truth is that the
      Cecils disliked him, and did all that they could decently do to keep him
      down. It has never been alleged that Bacon had done any thing to merit
      this dislike; nor is it at all probable that a man whose temper was
      naturally mild, whose manners were courteous, who, through life, nursed
      his fortunes with the utmost care, and who was fearful even to a fault of
      offending the powerful, would have given any just cause of displeasure to
      a kinsman who had the means of rendering him essential service and of
      doing him irreparable injury. The real explanation, <span class="pagenum">356</span><a
      name="link356" id="link356"></a>we believe, is this. Robert Cecil, the
      Treasurer&rsquo;s second son, was younger by a few months than Bacon. He had
      been educated with the utmost care, had been initiated while still a boy,
      in the mysteries of diplomacy and court-intrigue, and was just at this
      time about to be produced on the stage of public life. The wish nearest to
      Burleigh&rsquo;s heart was that his own greatness might descend to this
      favourite child. But even Burleigh&rsquo;s fatherly partiality could hardly
      prevent him from perceiving that Robert, with all his abilities and
      acquirements, was no match for his cousin Francis. This seems to us the
      only rational explanation of the Treasurer&rsquo;s conduct. Mr. Montagu is more
      charitable. He supposes that Burleigh was influenced merely by affection
      for his nephew, and was &ldquo;little deposed to encourage him to rely on others
      rather than on himself, and to venture on the quicksands of politics,
      instead of the certain profession of the law.&rdquo; If such were Burleigh&rsquo;s
      feelings, it seems strange that he should have suffered his son to venture
      on those quicksands from which he so carefully preserved his nephew. But
      the truth is that, if Burleigh had been so disposed, he might easily have
      secured to Bacon a comfortable provision which should have been exposed to
      no risk. And it is certain that he showed as little disposition to enable
      his nephew to live by a profession as to enable him to live without a
      profession. That Bacon himself attributed the conduct of his relatives to
      jealousy of his superior talents, we have not the smallest doubt. In a
      letter written many years later to Villiers, he expresses himself thus:
      &ldquo;Countenance, encourage, and advance able men in all kinds, degrees, and
      professions. For in the time of the Cecils, the father and the son, able
      men were by design and of purpose suppressed.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">357</span><a
      name="link357" id="link357"></a>Whatever Burleigh&rsquo;s motives might be, his
      purpose was unalterable. The supplications which Francis addressed to his
      uncle and aunt were earnest, humble, and almost servile. He was the most
      promising and accomplished young man of his time. His father had been the
      brother-in-law, the most useful colleague, the nearest friend of the
      Minister. But all this availed poor Francis nothing. He was forced, much
      against his will, to betake himself to the study of the law. He was
      admitted at Gray&rsquo;s Inn; and, during some years he laboured there in
      obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the extent of his legal attainments may have been it is difficult to
      say. It was not hard for a man of his powers to acquire that very moderate
      portion of technical knowledge which, when joined to quickness, tact, wit,
      ingenuity, eloquence, and knowledge of the world, is sufficient to raise
      an advocate to the highest professional eminence. The general opinion
      appears to have been that which was on one occasion expressed by
      Elizabeth. &ldquo;Bacon,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;hath a great wit and much learning; but in
      law showeth to the uttermost of his knowledge, and is not deep.&rdquo; The
      Cecils, we suspect, did their best to spread this opinion by whispers and
      insinuations. Coke openly proclaimed it with that rancorous insolence
      which was habitual to him. No reports are more readily believed than those
      which disparage genius, and soothe the envy of conscious mediocrity. It
      must have been inexpressibly consoling to a stupid sergeant, the
      forerunner of him who, a hundred and fifty years later, &ldquo;shook his head at
      Murray as a wit,&rdquo; to know that the most profound thinker and the most
      accomplished orator of the age was very imperfectly acquainted with the
      law touching <i>bastardeigne</i> and <i>mulier puisné</i>, and confounded
      <span class="pagenum">358</span><a name="link358" id="link358"></a>the
      right of free fishery with that of common of piscary.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is certain that no man in that age, or indeed during the century and a
      half which followed, was better acquainted than Bacon with the philosophy
      of law. His technical knowledge was quite sufficient, with the help of his
      admirable talents and of his insinuating address, to procure clients. He
      rose very rapidly into business, and soon entertained hopes of being
      called within the bar. He applied to Lord Burleigh for that purpose, but
      received a testy refusal. Of the grounds of that refusal we can, in some
      measure, judge by Bacon&rsquo;s answer, which is still extant. It seems that the
      old Lord, whose temper age and gout had by no means altered for the
      better, and who loved to mark his dislike of the showy, quick-witted young
      men of the rising generation, took this opportunity to read Francis a very
      sharp lecture on his vanity and want of respect for his betters. Francis
      returned a most submissive reply, thanked the Treasurer for the
      admonition, and promised to profit by it. Strangers meanwhile were less
      unjust to the young barrister than his nearest kinsman had been. In his
      twenty-sixth year he became a bencher of his Inn; and two years later he
      was appointed Lent reader. At length in 1500, he obtained for the first
      time some show of favour from the Court. He was sworn in Queen&rsquo;s Counsel
      extraordinary. But this mark of honour was not accompanied by any
      pecuniary emolument. He continued, therefore, to solicit his powerful
      relatives for some provision which might enable him to live without
      drudging at his profession. He bore, with a patience and serenity which,
      we fear, bordered on meanness, the morose humours of his uncle, and the
      sneering reflections which <span class="pagenum">359</span><a
      name="link359" id="link359"></a>his cousin cast on speculative men, lost
      in philosophical dreams, and too wise to be capable of transacting public
      business. At length the Cecils were generous enough to procure for him the
      reversion of the Registrarship of the Star Chamber. This was a lucrative
      place; but, as many years elapsed before it fell in, he was still under
      the necessity of labouring for his daily bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Parliament which was called in 1593 he sat as member for the county
      of Middlesex, and soon attained eminence as a debater. It is easy to
      perceive from the scanty remains of his oratory that the same compactness
      of expression and richness of fancy which appear in his writings
      characterized his speeches; and that his extensive acquaintance with
      literature and history enabled him to entertain his audience with a vast
      variety of illustrations and allusions which were generally happy and
      apposite, but which were probably not least pleasing to the taste of that
      age when they were such as would now be thought childish or pedantic. It
      is evident also that he was, as indeed might have been expected, perfectly
      free from those faults which are generally found in an advocate who, after
      having risen to eminence at the bar, enters the House of Commons; that it
      was his habit to deal with every great question, not in small detached
      portions, but as a whole; that he refined little, and that his reasonings
      were those of a capacious rather than a subtle mind. Ben Jonson, a most
      unexceptionable judge, has described Bacon&rsquo;s eloquence in words, which,
      though often quoted, will bear to be quoted again. &ldquo;There happened in my
      time one noble speaker who was full of gravity in his speaking. His
      language, where he could spare or pass by a jest, was nobly censorious. No
      man ever spoke more neatly, <span class="pagenum">360</span><a
      name="link360" id="link360"></a>more pressly, more weightily, or suffered
      less emptiness, less idleness, in what he uttered. No member of his speech
      but consisted of his own graces. His hearers could not cough or look aside
      from him without loss, he commanded where he spoke, and had his judges
      angry and pleased at his devotion. No man had their affections more in his
      power. The fear of every man that heard him was lest he should make an
      end.&rdquo; From the mention which is made of judges, it would seem that Jonson
      had heard Bacon only at the Bar. Indeed we imagine that the House of
      Commons was then almost inaccessible to strangers. It is not probable that
      a man of Bacon&rsquo;s nice observation would speak in Parliament exactly as he
      spoke in the Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench. But the graces of manner and language
      must, to a great extent, have been common between the Queen&rsquo;s Counsel and
      the Knight of the Shire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon tried to play a very difficult game in politics. He wished to be at
      once a favourite at Court and popular with the multitude. If any man could
      have succeeded in this attempt, a man of talents so rare, of judgment so
      prematurely ripe, of temper so calm, and of manners so plausible, might
      have been expected to succeed. Nor indeed did he wholly fail. Once,
      however, he indulged in a burst of patriotism which cost him a long and
      bitter remorse, and which he never ventured to repeat. The Court asked for
      large subsidies and for speedy payment. The remains of Bacon&rsquo;s speech
      breathe all the spirit of the Long Parliament. &ldquo;The gentlemen,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;must sell their plate, and the fanners their brass pots, ere this will be
      paid; and for us, we are here to search the wounds of the realm, and not
      to skim them over. The dangers <span class="pagenum">361</span><a
      name="link361" id="link361"></a>are these. First, we shall breed
      discontent and endanger her Majesty&rsquo;s safety, which must consist more in
      the love of the people than their wealth. Secondly, this being granted in
      this sort, other princes hereafter will look for the like; so that we
      shall put an evil precedent on ourselves and our posterity; and in
      histories, it is to be observed, of all nations the English are not to be
      subject, base, or taxable.&rdquo; The Queen and her ministers resented this
      outbreak of public spirit in the highest manner. Indeed, many an honest
      member of the House of Commons had, for a much smaller matter, been sent
      to the Tower by the proud and hot-blooded Tudors. The young patriot
      condescended to make the most abject apologies. He adjured the Lord
      Treasurer to show some favour to his poor servant and ally. He bemoaned
      himself to the Lord Keeper, in a letter which may keep in countenance the
      most unmanly of the epistles which Cicero wrote during his banishment. The
      lesson was not thrown away. Bacon never offended in the same manner again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now satisfied that he had little to hope from the patronage of
      those powerful kinsmen whom he had solicited during twelve years with such
      meek pertinacity; and he began to look towards a different quarter. Among
      the courtiers of Elizabeth had lately appeared a new favourite, young,
      noble, wealthy, accomplished, eloquent, brave, generous, aspiring; a
      favourite who had obtained from the grey-headed Queen such marks of regard
      as she had scarce vouchsafed to Leicester in the season of the passions;
      who was at once the ornament of the palace and the idol of the city; who
      was the common patron of men of letters and of men of the sword; who was
      the common <span class="pagenum">362</span><a name="link362" id="link362"></a>refuge
      of the persecuted Catholic and of the persecuted Puritan. The calm
      prudence which had enabled Burleigh to shape his course through so many
      dangers, and the vast experience which he had acquired in dealing with two
      generations of colleagues and rivals, seemed scarcely sufficient to
      support him in this new competition; and Robert Cecil sickened with fear
      and envy as he contemplated the rising fame and influence of Essex.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the factions which, towards the close of the reign of
      Elizabeth, divided her court and her council, though pregnant with
      instruction, is by no means interesting or pleasing. Both parties employed
      the means which are familiar to unscrupulous statesmen; and neither had,
      or even pretended to have, any important end in view. The public mind was
      then reposing from one great effort, and collecting strength for another.
      That impetuous and appalling rush with which the human intellect had moved
      forward in the career of truth and liberty, during the fifty years which
      followed the separation of Luther from the communion of the Church of
      Rome, was now over. The boundary between Protestantism and Popery had been
      fixed very nearly where it still remains. England, Scotland, the Northern
      kingdoms were on one side; Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, on the other.
      The line of demarcation ran, as it still runs, through the midst of the
      Netherlands, of Germany, and of Switzerland, dividing province from
      province, electorate from electorate, and canton from canton. France might
      be considered as a debatable land, in which the contest was still
      undecided. Since that time, the two religions have done little more than
      maintain their ground. A few occasional incursions have been made. But the
      general frontier remains <span class="pagenum">363</span><a name="link363"
       id="link363"></a>the same. During two hundred and fifty years no great
      society has risen up like one man, and emancipated itself by one mighty
      effort from the superstition of ages. This spectacle was common in the
      sixteenth century. Why has it ceased to be so? Why has so violent a
      movement been followed by so long a repose? The doctrines of the Reformers
      are not less agreeable to reason or to revelation now than formerly. The
      public mind is assuredly not less enlightened now than formerly. Why is it
      that Protestantism, after carrying every thing before it in a time of
      comparatively little knowledge and little freedom, should make no
      perceptible progress in a reasoning and tolerant age; that the Luthers,
      the Calvins, the Knoxes, the Zwingles, should have left no successors;
      that during two centuries and a half fewer converts should have been
      brought over from the Church of Rome than at the time of the Reformation
      were sometimes gained in a year? This has always appeared to us one of the
      most curious and interesting problems in history. On some future occasion
      we may perhaps attempt to solve it. At present it is enough to say that,
      at the close of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, the Protestant party, to borrow the
      language of the Apocalypse, had left its first love and had ceased to do
      its first works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great straggle of the sixteenth century was over. The great struggle
      of the seventeenth century had not commenced. The confessors of Mary&rsquo;s
      reign were dead. The members of the Long Parliament were still in their
      cradles. The Papists had been deprived of all power in the state. The
      Puritans had not yet attained any formidable extent of power. True it is
      that a student, well acquainted with the history of the next generation,
      can easily discern in the proceedings <span class="pagenum">364</span><a
      name="link364" id="link364"></a>of the last Parliaments of Elizabeth the
      germ of great and ever memorable events. But to the eye of a contemporary
      nothing of this appeared. The two sections of ambitious men who were
      struggling for power differed from each other on no important public
      question. Both belonged to the Established Church. Both professed
      boundless loyalty to the Queen. Both approved the war with Spain. There is
      not, so far as we are aware, any reason to believe that they entertained
      different views concerning the succession of the Crown. Certainly neither
      faction had any great measure of reform in view. Neither attempted to
      redress any public grievance. The most odious and pernicious grievance
      under which the nation then suffered was a source of profit to both, and
      was defended by both with equal zeal. Raleigh held a monopoly of cards,
      Essex a monopoly of sweet wines. In fact, the only ground of quarrel
      between the parties was that they could not agree as to their respective
      shares of power and patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in the political conduct of Essex entitles him to esteem; and the
      pity with which we regard his early and terrible end is diminished by the
      consideration, that he put to hazard the lives and fortunes of his most
      attached friends, and endeavoured to throw the whole country into
      confusion, for objects purely personal. Still, it is impossible not to be
      deeply interested for a man so brave, high-spirited, and generous; for a
      man who, while he conducted himself towards his sovereign with a boldness
      such as was then found in no other subject, conducted himself towards his
      dependents with a delicacy such as has rarely been found in any other
      patron. Unlike the vulgar herd of benefactors, he desired to inspire, not
      gratitude, but affection. He <span class="pagenum">365</span><a
      name="link365" id="link365"></a>tried to make those whom he befriended
      feel towards him as towards an equal. His mind, ardent, susceptible,
      naturally disposed to admiration of all that is great and beautiful, was
      fascinated by the genius and accomplishments of Bacon. A close friendship
      was soon formed between them, a friendship destined to have a dark, a
      mournful, a shameful end.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1504 the office of Attorney-General became vacant, and Bacon hoped to
      obtain it. Essex made his friend&rsquo;s cause his own, sued, expostulated,
      promised, threatened, but all in vain. It is probable that the dislike
      felt by the Cecils for Bacon had been increased by the connection which he
      had lately formed with the Earl. Robert was then on the point of being
      made Secretary of State. He happened one day to be in the same coach with
      Essex, and a remarkable conversation took place between them. &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo;
       said Sir Robert, &ldquo;the Queen has determined to appoint an Attorney-General
      without more delay. I pray your Lordship to let me know whom you will
      favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder at your question,&rdquo; replied the Earl. &ldquo;You cannot but know that
      resolutely, against all the world, I stand for your cousin, Francis
      Bacon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; cried Cecil, unable to bridle his temper, &ldquo;I wonder your
      Lordship should spend your strength on so unlikely a matter. Can you name
      one precedent of so raw a youth promoted to so great a place?&rdquo; This
      objection came with a singularly bad grace from a man who, though younger
      than Bacon, was in daily expectation of being made Secretary of State. The
      blot was too obvious to be missed by Essex, who seldom forbore to speak
      his mind. &ldquo;I have made no search,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for precedents of young men
      who have filled the office of Attorney-General. But I could name to you,
      <span class="pagenum">366</span><a name="link366" id="link366"></a>Sir
      Robert, a man younger than Francis, less learned, and equally
      inexperienced, who is suing and striving with all his might for an office
      of far greater weight.&rdquo; Sir Robert had nothing to say but that he thought
      his own abilities equal to the place which he hoped to obtain, and that
      his father&rsquo;s long services deserved such a mark of gratitude from the
      Queen; as if his abilities were comparable to his cousin&rsquo;s, or as if Sir
      Nicholas Bacon had done no service to the State. Cecil then hinted that,
      if Bacon would be satisfied with the Solicitorship, that might be of
      easier digestion to the Queen. &ldquo;Digest me no digestions,&rdquo; said the
      generous and ardent Earl. &ldquo;The Attorneyship for Francis is that I must
      have; and in that I will spend all my power, might, authority, and amity;
      and with tooth and nail procure the same for him against whomsoever; and
      whosoever getteth this office out of my hands for any other, before he
      have it, it shall cost him the coming by. And this be you assured of, Sir
      Robert, for now I fully declare myself; and for my own part, Sir Robert, I
      think strange both of my Lord Treasurer and you, that can have the mind to
      seek the preference of a stranger before so near a kinsman; for if you
      weigh in a balance the parts every way of his competitor and him, only
      excepting five poor years of admitting to a house of court before Francis,
      you shall find in all other respects whatsoever no comparison between
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the office of Attorney-General was filled up the Earl pressed the
      Queen to make Bacon Solicitor-General, and, on this occasion, the old Lord
      Treasurer professed himself not unfavourable to his nephew&rsquo;s pretensions.
      But, after a contest which lasted more than a year and a half, and in
      which Essex, to use his own <span class="pagenum">367</span><a
      name="link367" id="link367"></a>words, &ldquo;spent all his power, might,
      authority, and amity,&rdquo; the place was given to another. Essex felt this
      disappointment keenly, but found consolation in the most munificent and
      delicate liberality. He presented Bacon with an estate worth near two
      thousand pounds, situated at Twickenham; and this, as Bacon owned many
      years after, &ldquo;with so kind and noble circumstances as the manner was worth
      more than the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was soon after these events that Bacon first appeared before the public
      as a writer. Early in 1597 he published a small volume of Essays, which
      was afterwards enlarged by successive additions to many times its original
      bulk. This little work was, as it well deserved to be, exceedingly
      popular. It was reprinted in a few months; it was translated into Latin,
      French, and Italian; and it seems to have at once established the literary
      reputation of its author. But, though Bacon&rsquo;s reputation rose, his
      fortunes were still depressed. He was in great pecuniary difficulties; and
      on one occasion, was arrested in the street at the suit of a goldsmith for
      a debt of three hundred pounds, and was carried to a spunging-house in
      Coleman Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kindness of Essex was in the mean time indefatigable. In 1596 he
      sailed on his memorable expedition to the coast of Spain. At the very
      moment of his embarkation, he wrote to several of his friends, commending
      to them, during his own absence, the interests of Bacon. He returned,
      after performing the most brilliant military exploit that was achieved on
      the Continent by English arms during the long interval which elapsed
      between the battle of Agincourt and that of Blenheim. His valour, his
      talents, his humane and generous disposition, had made him the idol of his
      <span class="pagenum">368</span><a name="link368" id="link368"></a>countrymen,
      and had extorted praise from the enemies whom he had conquered. (1) He had
      always been proud and headstrong; and his splendid success seems to have
      rendered his faults more offensive than ever. But to his friend Francis he
      was still the same. Bacon had some thoughts of making his fortune by
      marriage, and had begun to pay court to a widow of the name of Hatton. The
      eccentric manners and violent temper of this woman made her a disgrace and
      a torment to her connections. But Bacon was not aware of her faults, or
      was disposed to overlook them for the sake of her ample fortune. Essex
      pleaded his friend&rsquo;s cause with his usual ardour. The letters which the
      Earl addressed to Lady Hatton and to her mother are still extant, and are
      highly honourable to him. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;she were my sister or my
      daughter, I protest I would as confidently resolve to further it as I now
      persuade you;&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;if my faith be any thing, I protest, if I had
      one as near me as she is to you, I had rather match her with him, than
      with men of far greater titles.&rdquo; The suit, happily for Bacon, was
      unsuccessful. The lady indeed was kind to him in more ways than one. She
      rejected him; and she accepted his enemy. She married that narrow-minded,
      bad-hearted pedant, Sir Edward Coke, and did her best to make him as
      miserable as he deserved to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fortunes of Essex had now reached their height, and began to decline.
      He possessed indeed all the qualities which raise men to greatness
      rapidly. But he had neither the virtues or the vices which enable men to
      retain greatness long. His frankness, his keen sensibility to insult and
      injustice were by no means

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">369</span><a name="link369" id="link369"></a>agreeable
      to a sovereign natural impatient of opposition, and accustomed, during
      forty years, to the most extravagant flattery and the most abject
      submission. The daring and contemptuous manner in which he bade defiance
      to his enemies excited their deadly hatred. His administration in Ireland
      was unfortunate, and in many respects highly blamable. Though his
      brilliant courage and his impetuous activity fitted him admirably for such
      enterprises as that of Cadiz, he did not possess the caution, patience,
      and resolution necessary for the conduct of a protracted war, in which
      difficulties were to be gradually surmounted, in which much discomfort was
      to be endured, and in which few splendid exploits could be achieved. For
      the civil duties of his high place he was still less qualified. Though
      eloquent and accomplished, he was in no sense a statesman. The multitude
      indeed still continued to regard even his faults with fondness. But the
      Court had ceased to give him credit, even for the merit which he really
      possessed. The person on whom, during the decline of his influence, he
      chiefly depended, to whom he confided his perplexities, whose advice he
      solicited, whose intercession he employed, was his friend Bacon. The
      lamentable truth must be told. This friend, so loved, so trusted, bore a
      principal part in mining the Earl&rsquo;s fortunes, in shedding his blood, and
      in blackening his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let us be just to Bacon. We believe that, to the last, he had no wish
      to injure Essex. Nay, we believe that he sincerely exerted himself to
      serve Essex, as long as he thought he could serve Essex without injuring
      himself. The advice which he gave to his noble benefactor was generally
      most judicious. He did all in his power to dissuade the Earl from
      accepting the Government of Ireland. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; says he, <span class="pagenum">370</span><a
      name="link370" id="link370"></a>"I did as plainly see his overthrow
      chained as it were by destiny to that journey, as it is possible for a man
      to ground a judgment upon future contingents.&rdquo; The prediction was
      accomplished. Essex returned in disgrace. Bacon attempted to mediate
      between his friend and the Queen; and, we believe, honestly employed all
      his address for that purpose. But the task which he had undertaken was too
      difficult, delicate, and perilous, even for so wary and dexterous an
      agent. He had to manage two spirits equally proud, resentful, and
      ungovernable. At Essex House, he had to calm the rage of a young hero
      incensed by multiplied wrongs and humiliations, and then to pass to
      Whitehall for the purpose of soothing the peevishness of a sovereign,
      whose temper, never very gentle, had been rendered morbidly irritable by
      age, by declining health, and by the long habit of listening to flattery
      and exacting implicit obedience. It is hard to serve two masters. Situated
      as Bacon was, it was scarcely possible for him to shape his course so as
      not to give one or both of his employers reason to complain. For a time he
      acted as fairly as, in circumstances so embarrassing, could reasonably be
      expected. At length he found that, while he was trying to prop the
      fortunes of another, he was in danger of shaking his own. He had
      disobliged both the parties whom he wished to reconcile. Essex thought him
      wanting in zeal as a friend: Elizabeth thought him wanting in duty as a
      subject. The Earl looked on him as a spy of the Queen; the Queen as a
      creature of the Earl. The reconciliation which he had laboured to effect
      appeared utterly hopeless. A thousand signs, legible to eyes far less keen
      than his, announced that the fall of his patron was at hand. He shaped his
      course accordingly. When Essex was <span class="pagenum">371</span><a
      name="link371" id="link371"></a>brought before the council to answer for
      his conduct in Ireland, Bacon, after a faint attempt to excuse himself
      from taking part against his friend, submitted himself&rsquo; to the Queen&rsquo;s
      pleasure, and appeared at the bar in support of the charges. But a darker
      scene was behind. The unhappy young nobleman, made reckless by despair,
      ventured on a rash and criminal enterprise, which rendered him liable to
      the highest penalties of the law. What course was Bacon to take? This was
      one of those conjunctures which show what men are. To a high-minded man,
      wealth, power, court-favor, even personal safety, would have appeared of
      no account, when opposed to friendship, gratitude, and honour. Such a man
      would have stood by the side of Essex at the trial, would have &ldquo;spent all
      his power, might, authority, and amity&rdquo; in soliciting a mitigation of the
      sentence, would have been a daily visitor at the cell, would have received
      the last injunctions and the last embrace on the scaffold, would have
      employed all the powers of his intellect to guard from insult the fame of
      his generous though erring friend. An ordinary man would neither have
      incurred the danger of succouring Essex, nor the disgrace of assailing
      him. Bacon did not even preserve neutrality. He appeared as counsel for
      the prosecution. In that situation he did not confine himself to what
      would have been amply sufficient to procure a verdict. He employed all his
      wit, his rhetoric, and his learning, not to insure a conviction,&mdash;for
      the circumstances were such that a conviction was inevitable,&mdash;but to
      deprive the unhappy prisoner of all those excuses which, though legally of
      no value, yet tended to diminish the moral guilt of the crime, and which,
      therefore, though they could not justify the peers in pronouncing an
      acquittal, might <span class="pagenum">372</span><a name="link372"
       id="link372"></a>incline the Queen to grant a pardon. The Earl urged as a
      palliation of his frantic acts that he was surrounded by powerful and
      inveterate enemies, that they had ruined his fortunes, that they sought
      his life, and that their persecutions had driven him to despair. This was
      true; and Bacon well knew it to be true. But he affected to treat it as an
      idle pretence. He compared Essex to Pisistratus who, by pretending to be
      in imminent danger of assassination, and by exhibiting self-inflicted
      wounds, succeeded in establishing tyranny at Athens. This was too much for
      the prisoner to bear. He interrupted his ungrateful friend by calling on
      him to quit the part of an advocate, to come forward as a witness, and to
      tell the Lords whether, in old times, he Francis Bacon, had not under his
      own hand, repeatedly asserted the truth of what he now represented as idle
      pretexts. It is painful to go on with this lamentable story. Bacon
      returned a shuffling answer to the Earl&rsquo;s question, and, as if the
      allusion to Pisistratus were not sufficiently offensive, made another
      allusion still more unjustifiable. He compared Essex to Henry Duke of
      Guise, and the rash attempt in the city to the day of the barricades at
      Paris. Why Bacon had recourse to such a topic it is difficult to say. It
      was quite unnecessary for the purpose of obtaining a verdict. It was
      certain to produce a strong impression on the mind of the haughty and
      jealous princess on whose pleasure the Earl&rsquo;s fate depended. The faintest
      allusion to the degrading tutelage in which the last Valois had been held
      by the House of Lorraine was sufficient to harden her heart against a man
      who in rank, in military reputation, in popularity among the citizens of
      the capital, bore some resemblance to the Captain of the League.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">373</span><a name="link373" id="link373"></a>Essex
      was convicted. Bacon made no effort to save him, though the Queen&rsquo;s
      feelings were such that he might have pleaded his benefactor&rsquo;s cause,
      possibly with success, certainly without any serious danger to himself.
      The unhappy nobleman was executed. His fate excited strong, perhaps
      unreasonable feelings of compassion and indignation. The Queen was
      received by the citizens of London with gloomy looks and faint
      acclamations. She thought it expedient to publish a vindication of her
      late proceedings. The faithless friend who had assisted in taking the
      Earl&rsquo;s life was now employed to murder the Earl&rsquo;s fame. The Queen had seen
      some of Bacon&rsquo;s writings, and had been pleased with them. He was
      accordingly selected to write &ldquo;A Declaration of the Practices and Treasons
      attempted and committed by Robert Earl of Essex,&rdquo; which was printed by
      authority. In the succeeding reign, Bacon had not a word to say in defence
      of this performance, a performance abounding in expressions which no
      generous enemy would have employed respecting a man who had so dearly
      expiated his offences. His only excuse was, that he wrote it by command,
      that he considered himself as a mere secretary, that he had particular
      instructions as to the way in which he was to treat every part of the
      subject, and that, in fact, he had furnished only the arrangement and the
      style.
    </p>
    <p>
      We regret to say that the whole conduct of Bacon through the course of
      these transactions appears to Mr. Montagu not merely excusable, but
      deserving of high admiration. The integrity and benevolence of this
      gentleman are so well known that our readers will probably be at a loss to
      conceive by what steps he can have arrived at so extraordinary a
      conclusion: and we are half afraid that they will suspect us of practising
      <span class="pagenum">374</span><a name="link374" id="link374"></a>some
      artifice upon them when we report the principal arguments which he
      employs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to get rid of the charge of ingratitude, Mr. Montagu attempts to
      show that Bacon lay under greater obligations to the Queen than to Essex.
      What these obligations were it is not easy to discover. The situation of
      Queen&rsquo;s Counsel, and a remote reversion, were surely favours very far
      below Bacon&rsquo;s personal and hereditary claims. They were favours which had
      not cost the Queen a groat, nor had they put a groat into Bacon&rsquo;s purse.
      It was necessary to rest Elizabeth&rsquo;s claims to gratitude on some other
      ground; and this Mr. Montagu felt. &ldquo;What perhaps was her greatest
      kindness,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;instead of having hastily advanced Bacon, she had,
      with a continuance of her friendship, made him bear the yoke in his youth.
      Such were his obligations to Elizabeth.&rdquo; Such indeed they were. Being the
      son of one of her oldest and most faithful ministers, being himself the
      ablest and most accomplished young man of his time, he had been condemned
      by her to drudgery, to obscurity, to poverty. She had depreciated his
      acquirements. She had checked him in the most imperious manner, when in
      Parliament he ventured to act an independent part. She had refused to him
      the professional advancement to which he had a just claim. To her it was
      owing that, while younger men, not superior to him in extraction, and far
      inferior to him in every kind of personal merit, were filling the highest
      offices of the state, adding manor to manor, rearing palace after palace,
      he was lying at a spunging-house for a debt of three hundred pounds.
      Assuredly if Bacon owed gratitude to Elizabeth, he owed none to Essex. If
      the Queen really was his best friend, the Earl was his worst enemy. <span
      class="pagenum">375</span><a name="link375" id="link375"></a>We wonder
      that Mr. Montagu did not press this argument a little further. He might
      have maintained that Bacon was excusable in revenging himself on a man who
      had attempted to rescue his youth from the salutary yoke imposed on it by
      the Queen, who had wished to advance him hastily, who, not content with
      attempting to inflict the Attorney-Generalship upon him, had been so cruel
      as to present him with a landed estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, we can hardly think Mr. Montagu serious when he tells us that Bacon
      was bound for the sake of the public not to destroy his own hopes of
      advancement, and that he took part against Essex from a wish to obtain
      power which might enable him to be useful to his country. We really do not
      know how to refute such arguments except by stating them. Nothing is
      impossible which does not involve a contradiction. It is barely possible
      that Bacon&rsquo;s motives for acting as he did on this occasion may have been
      gratitude to the Queen for keeping him poor, and a desire to benefit his
      fellow-creatures in some high situation. And there is a possibility that
      Bonner may have been a good Protestant who, being convinced that the blood
      of martyrs is the seed of the Church, heroically went through all the
      drudgery and infamy of persecution, in order that he might inspire the
      English people with an intense and lasting hatred of Popery. There is a
      possibility that Jeffreys may have been an ardent lover of liberty, and
      that he may have beheaded Algernon Sydney, and burned Elizabeth Gaunt,
      only in order to produce a reaction which might lead to the limitation of
      the prerogative. There is a possibility that Thurtell may have killed
      Weare only in order to give the youth of England an impressive warning
      against gaming and <span class="pagenum">376</span><a name="link376"
       id="link376"></a>bad company. There is a possibility that Fauntleroy may
      have forged powers of attorney, only in order that his fate might turn the
      attention of the public to the defects of the penal law. These things, we
      say, are possible. But they are so extravagantly improbable that a man who
      should act on such suppositions would be fit only for Saint Luke&rsquo;s. And we
      do not see why suppositions on which no rational man would act in ordinary
      life should be admitted into history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montagu&rsquo;s notion that Bacon desired power only in order to do good to
      mankind appears somewhat strange to us, when we consider how Bacon
      afterwards used power, and how he lost it. Surely the service which he
      rendered to mankind by taking Lady Wharton&rsquo;s broad pieces and Sir John
      Kennedy&rsquo;s cabinet was not of such vast importance as to sanctify all the
      means which might conduce to that end. If the case were fairly stated, it
      would, we much fear, stand thus: Bacon was a servile advocate, that he
      might be a corrupt judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montagu maintains that none but the ignorant and unreflecting can
      think Bacon censurable for any thing that he did as counsel for the Crown,
      and that no advocate can justifiably use any discretion as to the party
      for whom he appears. We will not at present inquire whether the doctrine
      which is held on this subject by English lawyers be or be not agreeable to
      reason and morality; whether it be right that a man should, with a wig on
      his head, and a band round his neck, do for a guinea what, without those
      appendages, he would think it wicked and infamous to do for an empire;
      whether it be right that, not merely believing but knowing a statement to
      be true, he should do all that can be done by sophistry, by rhetoric, by
      solemn <span class="pagenum">377</span><a name="link377" id="link377"></a>asseveration,
      by indignant exclamation, by gesture, by play of features, by terrifying
      one honest witness, by perplexing another, to cause a jury to think that
      statement false. It is not necessary on the present occasion to decide
      these questions. The professional rules, be they good or bad, are rules to
      which many wise and virtuous men have conformed, and are daily conforming.
      If, therefore, Bacon did no more than these rules required of him, we
      shall readily admit that he was blameless, or, at least, excusable. But we
      conceive that his con duct was not justifiable according to any
      professional rules that now exist, or that ever existed in England. It has
      always been held that, in criminal cases in which the prisoner was denied
      the help of counsel, and, above all, in capital cases, advocates were both
      entitled and bound to exercise a discretion. It is true that, after the
      Revolution, when the Parliament began to make inquisition for the innocent
      blood which had been shed by the last Stuarts, a feeble attempt was made
      to defend the lawyers who had been accomplices in the murder of Sir Thomas
      Armstrong, on the ground that they had only acted professionally. The
      wretched sophism was silenced by the execrations of the House of Commons.
      &ldquo;Things will never be well done,&rdquo; said Mr. Foley, &ldquo;till some of that
      profession be made examples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a new sort of monsters in the world,&rdquo; said the younger Hampden,
      &ldquo;haranguing a man to death. These I call bloodhounds. Sawyer is very
      criminal and guilty of this murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak to discharge my conscience,&rdquo; said Mr. Garroway. &ldquo;I will not have
      the blood of this man at my door. Sawyer demanded judgment against him and
      execution. I believe him guilty of the death <span class="pagenum">378</span><a
      name="link378" id="link378"></a>of this man. Do what you will with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the profession of the law,&rdquo; said the elder Hampden, &ldquo;gives a man
      authority to murder at this rate, it is the interest of all men to rise
      and exterminate that profession.&rdquo; Nor was this language held only by
      unlearned country gentlemen. Sir William Williams, one of the ablest and
      most unscrupulous lawyers of the age, took the same view of the case. He
      had not hesitated, he said, to take part in the prosecution of the
      Bishops, because they were allowed counsel. But he maintained that, where
      the prisoner was not allowed counsel, the Counsel for the Crown was bound
      to exercise a discretion, and that every lawyer who neglected this
      distinction was a betrayer of the law. But it is unnecessary to cite
      authority. It is known to every body who has ever looked into a court of
      quarter-sessions that lawyers do exercise a discretion in criminal cases;
      and it is plain to every man of common sense that, if they did not
      exercise such a discretion, they would be a more hateful body of men than
      those bravoes who used to hire out their stilettoes in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon appeared against a man who was indeed guilty of a great offence, but
      who had been his benefactor and friend. He did more than this. Nay, he did
      more than a person who had never seen Essex would have been justified in
      doing. He employed all the art of an advocate in order to make the
      prisoner&rsquo;s conduct appear more inexcusable and more dangerous to the state
      than it really had been. All that professional duty could, in any case,
      have required of him would have been to conduct the cause so as to insure
      a conviction. But from the nature of the circumstances there could not be
      the smallest doubt that the Earl would be found guilty. The character of
      the <span class="pagenum">379</span><a name="link379" id="link379"></a>crime
      was unequivocal. It had been committed recently, in broad daylight, in the
      streets of the capital, in the presence of thousands. If ever there was an
      occasion on which an advocate had no temptation to resort to extraneous
      topics, for the purpose of blinding the judgment and inflaming the
      passions of a tribunal, this was that occasion. Why then resort to
      arguments which, while they could add nothing to the strength of the case,
      considered in a legal point of view, tended to aggravate the moral guilt
      of the fatal enterprise, and to excite fear and resentment in that quarter
      from which alone the Earl could now expect mercy? Why remind the audience
      of the arts of the ancient tyrants? Why deny, what every body knew to be
      the truth, that a powerful faction at court had long sought to effect the
      ruin of the prisoner? Why, above all, institute a parallel between the
      unhappy culprit and the most wicked and most successful rebel of the age?
      Was it absolutely impossible to do all that professional duty required
      without reminding a jealous sovereign of the League, of the barricades,
      and of all the humiliations which a too powerful subject had heaped on
      Henry the Third?
    </p>
    <p>
      But if we admit the plea which Mr. Montagu urges in defence of what Bacon
      did as an advocate, what shall we say of the &ldquo;Declaration of the Treasons
      of Robert Earl of Essex?&rdquo; Here at least there was no pretence of
      professional obligation. Even those who may think it the duty of a lawyer
      to hang, draw, and quarter his benefactors, for a proper consideration,
      will hardly say that it is his duty to write abusive pamphlets against
      them, after they are in their graves. Bacon excused himself by saying that
      he was not answerable for the matter of the book, and that he furnished
      only <span class="pagenum">380</span><a name="link380" id="link380"></a>the
      language. But why did lie endow such purposes with words? Could no hack
      writer, without virtue or shame, be found to exaggerate the errors,
      already so dearly expiated, of a gentle and noble spirit? Every age
      produces those links between the man and the baboon. Every age is fertile
      of Oldmixons, of Kenricks, and of Antony Pasquins. But was it for Bacon so
      to prostitute his intellect? Could he not feel that, while he rounded and
      pointed some period dictated by the envy of Cecil, or gave a plausible
      form to some slander invented by the dastardly malignity of Cobliam, he
      was not sinning merely against his friend&rsquo;s honour and his own? Could he
      not feel that letters, eloquence, philosophy, were all degraded in his
      degradation?
    </p>
    <p>
      The real explanation of all this is perfectly obvious; and nothing but a
      partiality amounting to a ruling passion could cause any body to miss it.
      The moral qualities of Bacon were not of a high order. We do not say that
      he was a bad man. He was not inhuman or tyrannical. He bore with meekness
      his high civil honours, and the far higher honours gained by his
      intellect. He was very seldom, if ever, provoked into treating any person
      with malignity and insolence. Ko man more readily held up the left cheek
      to those who had smitten the right. No man was more expert at the soft
      answer which turneth away wrath. He was never charged, by any accuser
      entitled to the smallest credit, with licentious habits. His even temper,
      his flowing courtesy, the general respectability of his demeanour, made a
      favourable impression on those who saw him in situations which do not
      severely try the principles. His faults were&mdash;we write it with pain&mdash;coldness
      of heart, and meanness of spirit. He seems to have been incapable of
      feeling strong affection, of <span class="pagenum">381</span><a
      name="link381" id="link381"></a>facing great dangers, of making great
      sacrifices. His desires were set on things below. Wealth, precedence,
      titles, patronage, the mace, the seals, the coronet, large houses, fair
      gardens, rich manors, massive services of plate, gay hangings, curious
      cabinets, had as great attractions for him as for any of the courtiers who
      dropped on their knees in the dirt when Elizabeth passed by, and then
      hastened home to write to the King of Scots that her Grace seemed to be
      breaking fast. For these objects he had stooped to every thing and endured
      every thing. For these he had sued in the humblest manner, and, when
      unjustly and ungraciously repulsed, had thanked those who had repulsed
      him, and had begun to sue again. For these objects, as soon as he found
      that the smallest show of independence in Parliament was offensive to the
      Queen, he had abased himself to the dust before her, and implored
      forgiveness in terms better suited to a convicted thief than to a knight
      of the shire. For these he joined, and for these he forsook, Lord Essex.
      He continued to plead his patron&rsquo;s cause with the Queen as long as he
      thought that by pleading that cause he might serve himself. Nay, he went
      further; for his feelings, though not warm, were kind; he pleaded that
      cause as long as he thought that he could plead it without injury to
      himself. But when it became evident that Essex was going headlong to his
      ruin, Bacon began to tremble for his own fortunes. What he had to fear
      would not indeed have been very alarming to a man of lofty character. It
      was not death. It was not imprisonment. It was the loss of court favour.
      It was the being left behind by others in the career of ambition. It was
      the having leisure to finish the <i>Instauratio Magna</i>. The Queen
      looked coldly on him. The courtiers began to consider him as a marked
      <span class="pagenum">382</span><a name="link382" id="link382"></a>man. He
      determined to change his line of conduct, and to proceed in a new course
      with so much vigour as to make up for lost time. When once he had
      determined to act against his friend, knowing himself to be suspected, he
      acted with more zeal than would have been necessary or justifiable if he
      had been employed against a stranger. He exerted his professional talents
      to shed the Earl&rsquo;s blood, and his literary talents to blacken the Earl&rsquo;s
      memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is certain that his conduct excited at the time great and general
      disapprobation. While Elizabeth lived, indeed, this disapprobation, though
      deeply felt, was not loudly expressed. But a great change was at hand. The
      health of the Queen had long been decaying; and the operation of age and
      disease was now assisted by acute mental suffering. The pitiable
      melancholy of her last days has generally been ascribed to her fond regret
      for Essex. But we are disposed to attribute her dejection partly to
      physical causes, and partly to the conduct of her courtiers and ministers.
      They did all in their power to conceal from her the intrigues which they
      were carrying on at the Court of Scotland. But her keen sagacity was not
      to be so deceived. She did not know the whole. But she knew that she was
      surrounded by men who were impatient for that new world which was to begin
      at her death, who had never been attached to her by affection, and who
      were now but very slightly attached to her by interest. Prostration and
      flattery could not conceal from her the cruel truth, that those whom she
      had trusted and promoted had never loved her, and were fast ceasing to
      fear her. Unable to avenge herself, and too proud to complain, she
      suffered sorrow and resentment to prey on her heart, till, after a <span
      class="pagenum">383</span><a name="link383" id="link383"></a>long career
      of power, prosperity, and glory, she died sick and weary of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      James mounted the throne: and Bacon employed all his address to obtain for
      himself a share of the favour of his new master. This was no difficult
      task. The faults of James, both as a man and as a prince, were numerous;
      but insensibility to the claims of genius and learning was not among them.
      He was indeed made up of two men, a witty, well-read scholar, who wrote,
      disputed and harangued, and a nervous, drivelling; idiot, who acted. If he
      had been a Canon of Christ Church, or a Prebendary of Westminster, it is
      not improbable that he would have left a highly respectable name to
      posterity; that he would have distinguished himself among the translators
      of the Bible, and among the Divines who attended the Synod of Dort; and
      that he would have been regarded by the literary world as no contemptible
      rival of Vossius and Casanbon. But fortune placed him in a situation in
      which his weaknesses covered him with disgrace, and in which his
      accomplishments brought him no honour. In a college, much eccentricity and
      childishness would have been readily pardoned in so learned a man. But all
      that learning; could do for him on the throne was to make people think him
      a pedant as well as a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon was favourably received at Court; and soon found that his chance of
      promotion was not diminished by the death of the Queen. He was solicitous
      to be knighted, for two reasons which are somewhat amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King had already dubbed half London, and Bacon found himself the only
      untitled person in his mess at Gray&rsquo;s Inn. This was not very agreeable to
      him. He had also, to quote his own words, &ldquo;found an Alderman&rsquo;s daughter, a
      handsome maiden, to his <span class="pagenum">384</span><a name="link384"
       id="link384"></a>liking.&rdquo; On both these grounds, he begged his cousin
      Robert Cecil, &ldquo;if it might please his good Lordship,&rdquo; to use his interest
      in his behalf. The application was successful. Bacon was one of three
      hundred gentlemen who, on the coronation-day, received the honour, if it
      is to be so called, of knighthood. The handsome maiden, a daughter of
      Alderman Barnham, soon after consented to become Sir Francis&rsquo;s lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of Elizabeth, though on the whole it improved Bacon&rsquo;s prospects,
      was in one respect an unfortunate event for him. The new King had always
      felt kindly towards Lord Essex, and, as soon as he came to the throne,
      began to show favour to the house of Devereux, and to those who had stood
      by that house in its adversity. Everybody was now at liberty to speak out
      respecting those lamentable events in which Bacon had borne so large a
      share. Elizabeth was scarcely cold when the public feeling began to
      manifest itself by marks of respect towards Lord Southampton. That
      accomplished nobleman, who will be remembered to the latest ages as the
      generous and discerning patron of Shakspeare, was held in honour by his
      contemporaries chiefly on account of the devoted affection which he had
      borne to Essex. He had been tried and convicted together with his friend;
      but the Queen had spared his life, and, at the time of her death, he was
      still a prisoner. A crowd of visitors hastened to the Tower to
      congratulate him on his approaching deliverance. With that crowd Bacon
      could not venture to mingle. The multitude loudly condemned him; and his
      conscience told him that the multitude had but too much reason. He excused
      himself to Southampton by letter, in terms which, if he had, as Mr.
      Montagu conceives, done only what as a subject and an advocate he was
      bound to do, <span class="pagenum">385</span><a name="link385" id="link385"></a>must
      be considered as shamefully servile. He owns his fear that his attendance
      would give offence, and that his professions of regard would obtain no
      credit. &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;it is as true as a thing that God knoweth, that
      this great chancre hath wrought in me no other change towards your
      Lordship than this, that I may safely be that to you now which I was truly
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How Southampton received these apologies we are not informed. But it is
      certain that the general opinion was pronounced against Bacon in a manner
      not to be misunderstood. Soon after his marriage he put forth a defence of
      his conduct, in the form of a letter to the Earl of Devon. This tract
      seems to us to prove only the exceeding badness of a cause for which such
      talents could do so little.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not probable that Bacon&rsquo;s Defence had much effect on his
      contemporaries. But the unfavourable impression which his conduct had made
      appears to have been gradually effaced. Indeed it must be some very
      peculiar cause that can make a man like him long unpopular. His talents
      secured him from contempt, his temper and his manners from hatred. There
      is scarcely any story so black that it may not be got over by a man of
      great abilities, whose abilities are united with caution, good-humour,
      patience, and affability, who pays daily sacrifice to Nemesis, who is a
      delightful companion, a serviceable though not an ardent friend, and a
      dangerous yet a placable enemy. Waller in the next generation was an
      eminent instance of this. Indeed Waller had much more than may at first
      sight appear in common with Bacon. To the higher intellectual qualities of
      the great English philosopher, to the genius which has made an immortal
      epoch in the history of <span class="pagenum">386</span><a name="link386"
       id="link386"></a>science, Waller had indeed no pretensions. But the mind
      of Waller, as far as it extended, coincided with that of Bacon, and might,
      so to speak, have been cut out of that of Bacon. In the qualities which
      make a man an object of interest and veneration to posterity, they cannot
      be compared together. But in the qualities by which chiefly a man is known
      to his contemporaries there was a striking similarity between them.
      Considered as men of the world, as courtiers, as politicians, as
      associates, as allies, as enemies, they had nearly the same merits, and
      the same defects. They were not malignant. They were not tyrannical. But
      they wanted warmth of affection and elevation of sentiment. There were
      many things which they loved better than virtue, and which they feared
      more than guilt. Yet, even after they had stooped to acts of which it is
      impossible to read the account in the most partial narratives without
      strong disapprobation and contempt, the public still continued to regard
      them with a feeling not easily to be distinguished from esteem. The
      hyperbole of Juliet seemed to be verified with respect to them. &ldquo;Upon
      their brows shame was ashamed to sit.&rdquo; Everybody seemed as desirous to
      throw&rsquo; a veil over their misconduct as if it had been his own. Clarendon,
      who felt, and who had reason to feel, strong personal dislike towards Y
      aller, speaks of him thus: &ldquo;There needs no more to be said to extol the
      excellence and power of his wit and pleasantness of his conversation, than
      that it was of magnitude enough to cover a world of very great faults,
      that is, so to cover them that they were not taken notice of to his
      reproach, viz. a narrowness in his nature to the lowest degree, an
      abjectness and want of courage to support him in any virtuous undertaking,
      an insinuation and servile flattery to the height <span class="pagenum">387</span><a
      name="link387" id="link387"></a>the vainest and most imperious nature
      could be contented with.... It had power to reconcile him to those whom he
      had most offended and provoked, and continued to his age with that rare
      felicity, that his company was acceptable where his spirit was odious, and
      he was at least pitied where he was most detested.&rdquo; Much of this, with
      some softening, might, we fear, be applied to Bacon. The influence of
      Waller&rsquo;s talents, manners, and accomplishments, died with him; and the
      world has pronounced an unbiassed sentence on his character. A few flowing
      lines are not bribe sufficient to pervert the judgment of posterity. But
      the influence of Bacon is felt and will long be felt over the whole
      civilised world. Leniently as he was treated by his contemporaries,
      posterity has treated him more leniently still. Turn where we may, the
      trophies of that mighty intellect are full in view. We are judging Manlius
      in sight of the Capitol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the reign of James, Bacon grew rapidly in fortune and favour. In
      1604 he was appointed King&rsquo;s Counsel, with a fee of forty pounds a year;
      and a pension of sixty pounds a year was settled upon him. In 1607 he
      became Solicitor-General, in 1612 Attorney-General. He continued to
      distinguish himself in Parliament, particularly by his exertions in favour
      of one excellent measure on which the King&rsquo;s heart was set, the union of
      England and Scotland. It was not difficult for such an intellect to
      discover many irresistible arguments in favour of such a scheme. He
      conducted the great case of the <i>Post Nati</i> in the Exchequer Chamber;
      and the decision of the judges, a decision the legality of which may be
      questioned, but the beneficial effect of which must be acknowledged, was
      in a great measure attributed to his dexterous management. <span
      class="pagenum">388</span><a name="link388" id="link388"></a>While
      actively engaged in the House of Commons and in the courts of law, he
      still found leisure for letters and philosophy. The noble treatise on the
      &ldquo;Advancement of Learning,&rdquo; which at a later period was expanded into the
      <i>De Augmentis</i>, appeared in 1605. The &ldquo;Wisdom of the Ancients,&rdquo; a
      work which, if it had proceeded from any other writer, would have been
      considered as a masterpiece of wit and learning, but which adds little to
      the fame of Bacon, was printed in 1609. In the mean time the <i>Novum
      Organum</i> was slowly proceeding. Several distinguished men of learning
      had been permitted to see sketches or detached portions of that
      extraordinary book; and, though they were not generally disposed to admit
      the soundness of the author&rsquo;s views, they spoke with the greatest
      admiration of his genius. Sir Thomas Bodley, the founder of one of the
      most magnificent of English libraries, was among those stubborn
      Conservatives who considered the hopes with which Bacon looked forward to
      the future destinies of the human race as utterly chimerical, and who
      regarded with distrust and aversion the innovating spirit of the new
      schismatics in philosophy. Yet even Bodley, after perusing the <i>Cogitata
      et Visa</i>, one of the most precious of those scattered leaves out of
      which the great oracular volume was afterwards made up, acknowledged that
      in &ldquo;those very points, and in all proposals and plots in that book, Bacon
      showed himself a master-workman;&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it could not be gainsaid but
      all the treatise over did abound with choice conceits of the present state
      of learning, and with worthy contemplations of the means to procure it.&rdquo;
       In 1612, a new edition of the &ldquo;Essays&rdquo; appeared, with additions surpassing
      the original collection both in bulk and quality. Nor did <span
      class="pagenum">389</span><a name="link389" id="link389"></a>these
      pursuits distract Bacon&rsquo;s attention from a work the most arduous, the most
      glorious, and the most useful that even his mighty powers could have
      achieved, &ldquo;the reducing and recompiling,&rdquo; to use his own phrase, &ldquo;of the
      laws of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily he was at that very time employed in perverting those laws to
      the vilest purposes of tyranny. When Oliver St. John was brought before
      the Star Chamber for maintaining that the King had no right to levy
      Benevolences, and was for his manly and constitutional conduct sentenced
      to imprisonment during the royal pleasure and to a fine of five thousand
      pounds, Bacon appeared as counsel for the prosecution. About the same time
      he was deeply engaged in a still more disgraceful transaction. An aged
      clergyman, of the name of Peacham, was accused of treason on account of
      some passages of a sermon which was found in his study. The sermon,
      whether written by him or not, had never been preached. It did not appear
      that he had any intention of preaching it. The most servile lawyers of
      those servile times were forced to admit that there were great
      difficulties both as to the facts and as to the law. Bacon was employed to
      remove those difficulties. He was employed to settle the question of law
      by tampering with the judges, and the question of fact by torturing the
      prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three judges of the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench were tractable. But Coke was
      made of different stuff. Pedant, bigot, and brute as he was, he had
      qualities which bore a strong, though a very disagreeable resemblance to
      some of the highest virtues which a public man can possess. He was an
      exception to a maxim which we believe to be generally true, that those who
      trample on the helpless are disposed to cringe to the powerful. <span
      class="pagenum">390</span><a name="link390" id="link390"></a>He behaved
      with gross rudeness to his juniors at the bar, and with execrable cruelty
      to prisoners on trial for their lives. But he stood up manfully against
      the King and the King&rsquo;s favourites. No man of that age appeared to so
      little advantage when he was opposed to an inferior, and was in the wrong.
      But, on the other hand, it is but fair to admit that no man of that age
      made so creditable a figure when he was opposed to a superior, and
      happened to be in the right. On such occasions, his half-suppressed
      insolence and his impracticable obstinacy had a respectable and
      interesting appearance, when compared with the abject servility of the bar
      and of the bench. On the present occasion he was stubborn and surly. He
      declared that it was a new and a highly improper practice in the judges to
      confer with a law-officer of the crown about capital cases which they were
      afterwards to try; and for some time he resolutely kept aloof. But Bacon
      was equally artful and persevering. &ldquo;I am not wholly out of hope,&rdquo; said he
      in a letter to the King, &ldquo;that my Lord Coke himself, when I have in some
      dark manner put him in doubt that he shall be left alone, will not be
      singular.&rdquo; After some time Bacon&rsquo;s dexterity was successful; and Coke,
      sullenly and reluctantly, followed the example of his brethren. But in
      order to convict Peacham it was necessary to find facts as well as law.
      Accordingly, this wretched old man was put to the rack, and, while
      undergoing the horrible infliction, was examined by Bacon, but in vain. No
      confession could be wrung out of him; and Bacon wrote to the King,
      complaining that Peacham had a dumb devil. At length the trial came on. A
      conviction was obtained; but the charges were so obviously futile, that
      the government could not, for very shame, carry the sentence into
      execution; and <span class="pagenum">391</span><a name="link391"
       id="link391"></a>Peacham was suffered to languish away the short remainder
      of his life in a prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this frightful story Mr. Montagu relates fairly. He neither conceals
      nor distorts any material fact. But he can see nothing deserving of
      condemnation in Bacon&rsquo;s conduct. He tells us most truly that we ought not
      to try the men of one age by the standard of another; that Sir Matthew
      Hale is not to be pronounced a bad man because he left a woman to be
      executed for witchcraft; that posterity will not be justified in censuring
      judges of our time, for selling offices in their courts, according to the
      established practice, bad as that practice was; and that Bacon is entitled
      to similar indulgence. &ldquo;To persecute the lover of truth,&rdquo; says Mr.
      Montagu, &ldquo;for opposing established customs, and to censure him in after
      ages for not having been more strenuous in opposition, are errors which
      will never cease until the pleasure of self-elevation from the depression
      of superiority is no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We have no dispute with Mr. Montagu about the general proposition. We
      assent to every word of it. But does it apply to the present case? Is it
      true that in the time of James the First it was the established practice
      for the law-officers of the Crown, to hold private consultations with the
      judges, touching capital cases which those judges were afterwards to try?
      Certainly not. In the very page in which Mr. Montagu asserts that &ldquo;the
      influencing a judge out of court seems at that period scarcely to have
      been considered as improper,&rdquo; he gives the very words of Sir Edward Coke
      on the subject. &ldquo;I will not thus declare what may be my judgment by these
      auricular confessions of <i>new</i> and pernicious tendency, and <i>not
      according to the customs of the realm</i>.&rdquo; Is it possible to imagine that
      Coke, who <span class="pagenum">392</span><a name="link392" id="link392"></a>had
      himself been Attorney-General during thirteen years, who had conducted a
      far greater number of important state-prosecutions than any other lawyer
      named in English history, and who had passed with scarcely any interval
      from the Attorney-Generalship to the first scat in the first criminal
      court in the realm, could have been startled at an invitation to confer
      with the crown-lawyers, and could have pronounced the practice new, if it
      had really been an established usage? We well know that, where property
      only was at stake, it was then a common, though a most culpable practice,
      in the judges, to listen to private solicitations. But the practice ot
      tampering with judges in order to procure capital convictions we believe
      to have been new, first, because Coke, who understood those matters better
      than any man of his time, asserted it to be new; and secondly, because
      neither Bacon nor Mr. Montagu has shown a single precedent.
    </p>
    <p>
      How then stands the case? Even thus: Bacon was not conforming to an usage
      then generally admitted to be proper. He was not even the last lingering
      adherent of an old abuse. It would have been sufficiently disgraceful to
      such a man to be in this last situation. Yet this last situation would
      have been honourable compared with that in which he stood. He was guilty
      of attempting to introduce into the courts of law an odious abuse for
      which no precedent could be found. Intellectually, he was better fitted
      than any man that England has ever produced for the work of improving her
      institutions. But, unhappily, we see that he did not scruple to exert his
      great powers for the purpose of introducing into those institutions new
      corruptions of the foulest kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same, or nearly the same, may be said of the <span class="pagenum">393</span><a
      name="link393" id="link393"></a>torturing of Peacham. If it be true that
      in the time of James the First the propriety of torturing prisoners was
      generally allowed, we should admit this as an excuse, though we should
      admit it less readily in the case of such a man as Bacon than in the case
      of an ordinary lawyer or politician. But the fact is, that the practice of
      torturing prisoners was then generally acknowledged by lawyers to be
      illegal, and was execrated by the public as barbarous. More than thirty
      years before Peacham&rsquo;s trial, that practice was so loudly condemned by the
      voice of the nation that Lord Burleigh found it necessary to publish an
      apology for having occasionally resorted to it. But though the dangers
      which then threatened the government were of a very different kind from
      those which were to be apprehended from any thing that Peacham could
      write, though the life of the Queen and the dearest interests of the state
      were in jeopardy, though the circumstances were such that all ordinary
      laws might seem to be superseded by that highest law, the public safety,
      the apology did not satisfy the country: and the Queen found it expedient
      to issue an order positively forbidding the torturing of state-prisoners
      on any pretence whatever. From that time, the practice of torturing, which
      had always been unpopular, which had always been illegal, had also been
      unusual. It is well known that in 1628, only fourteen years after the time
      when Bacon went to the Tower to listen to the yells of Peacham, the judges
      decided that Felton, a criminal who neither deserved nor was likely to
      obtain any extraordinary indulgence, could not lawfully be put to the
      question. We therefore say that Bacon stands in a very different situation
      from that in which Mr. Montagu tries to place him. Bacon was here
      distinctly behind his <span class="pagenum">394</span><a name="link394"
       id="link394"></a>age. He was one of the last of the tools of power who
      persisted in a practice the most barbarous and the most absurd that has
      ever disgraced jurisprudence, in a practice of which, in the preceding
      generation, Elizabeth and her ministers had been ashamed, in a practice
      which, a few years later, no sycophant in all the Inns of Court had the
      heart or the forehead to defend. (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon far behind his age! Bacon far behind Sir Edward Coke! Bacon clinging
      to exploded abuses! Bacon withstanding the progress of improvement! Bacon
      struggling to push back the human mind! The words seem strange. They sound
      like a contradiction in terms. Yet the fact is even so: and the
      explanation may be readily found by any person who is not blinded by
      prejudice. Mr. Montagu cannot believe that so extraordinary a man as Bacon
      could be guilty of a bad action; as if history were not made up of the bad
      actions of extraordinary men, as if all the most noted destroyers and
      deceivers of our species, all the founders of arbitrary governments and
      false religions, had not been extraordinary men, as if nine tenths of the
      calamities which have befallen the human race had any other origin than
      the union of high intelligence with low desires.

      Bacon knew this well. He has told us that there

     a very learned and ingenious Reading on the use of torture
     in England. It has not, however, been thought necessary to
     make any change in the observations on Peacham&rsquo;s case.

     It is impossible to discuss within the limits of a note, the
     extensive question raised by Mr. Jardine. It is sufficient
     here to say that every argument by which he attempts to show
     that the use of the rack was anciently a lawful exertion of
     royal prerogative may be urged with equal force, nay with
     far greater force, to prove the lawfulness of benevolences,
     of ship-money, of Mompesson&rsquo;s patent, of Eliot&rsquo;s
     imprisonment, of every abuse, without exception, which is
     condemned by the Petition of Right and the Declaration of

      sagacity and his extensive converse with mankind to make the discovery.
      Indeed, he had only to look within. The difference between the soaring
      angel and the creeping snake was but a type of the difference between
      Bacon the philosopher and Bacon the Attorney-General, Bacon seeking for
      truth, and Bacon seeking for the Seals. Those who survey only one half of
      his character may speak of him with unmixed admiration, or with unmixed
      contempt. But those only judge of him correctly who take in at one view
      Bacon in speculation and Bacon in action. They will have no difficulty in
      comprehending how one and the same man should have been far before his age
      and far behind it, in one line the boldest and most useful of innovators,
      in another line the most obstinate champion of the foulest abuses. In his
      library, all his rare powers were under the guidance of an honest
      ambition, of an enlarged philanthropy, of a sincere love of truth. There,
      no temptation drew him away from the right course. Thomas Aquinas could
      pay no fees, Duns Scotus could confer no peerages. The Master of the
      Sentences had no rich reversions in his gift. Far different was the
      situation of the great philosopher when he came forth from his study and
      his laboratory to mingle with the crowd which filled the galleries of
      Whitehall. In all that crowd there was no man equally qualified to render
      great and lasting services to mankind. But in all that crowd there was not
      a heart more set on things which no man ought to suffer to be necessary to

      happiness, on things which can often be obtained only by the sacrifice of
      integrity and honour. To be the leader of the human race in the career of
      improvement, to found on the ruins of ancient intellectual dynasties a
      more prosperous and a more enduring empire, to be revered by the latest
      generations as the most illustrious among the benefactors of mankind, all
      this was within his reach. But all this availed him nothing while some
      quibbling special pleader was promoted before him to the bench, while some
      heavy country gentleman took precedence of him by virtue of a purchased
      coronet, while some pandar, happy in a fair wife, could obtain a more
      cordial salute from Buckingham, while some buffoon, versed in all the
      latest scandal of the court, could draw a louder laugh from James.
    </p>
    <p>
      During a long course of years, Bacon&rsquo;s unworthy ambition was crowned with
      success. His sagacity early enabled him to perceive who was likely to
      become the most powerful man in the kingdom. He probably knew the King&rsquo;s
      mind before it was known to the King himself, and attached himself to
      Villiers, while the less discerning crowd of courtiers still continued to
      fawn on Somerset. The influence of the younger favourite became greater
      daily. The contest between the rivals might, however, have lasted long,
      but for that frightful crime which, in spite of all that could be effected
      by the research and ingenuity of historians, is still covered with so
      mysterious an obscurity. The descent of Somerset had been a gradual and
      almost imperceptible lapse. It now became a headlong fall; and Villiers,
      left without a competitor, rapidly rose to a height of power such as no
      subject since Wolsey had attained. <span class="pagenum">397</span><a
      name="link397" id="link397"></a>There were many points of resemblance
      between the two celebrated courtiers who, at different times, extended
      their patronage to Bacon. It is difficult to say whether Essex or Villiers
      was more eminently distinguished by those graces of person and manner
      which have always been rated in courts at much more than their real value.
      Both were constitutionally brave; and both, like most men who are
      constitutionally brave, were open and unreserved. Both were rash and
      headstrong. Both were destitute of the abilities and of the information
      which are necessary to statesmen. Yet both, trusting to the
      accomplishments which had made them conspicuous in tilt-yards and
      ball-rooms, aspired to rule the state. Both owed their elevation to the
      personal attachment of the sovereign; and in both cases this attachment
      was of so eccentric a kind, that it perplexed observers, that it still
      continues to perplex historians, and that it gave rise to much scandal
      which we are inclined to think unfounded. Each of them treated the
      sovereign whose favour he enjoyed with a rudeness which approached to
      insolence. This petulance ruined Essex, who had to deal with a spirit
      naturally as proud as his own, and accustomed, during near half a century,
      to the most respectful observance. But there was a wide difference between
      the haughty daughter of Henry and her successor. James was timid from the
      cradle. His nerves, naturally weak, had not been fortified by reflection
      or by habit. His life, till he came to England, had been a series of
      mortifications and humiliations. With all his high notions of the origin
      and extent of his prerogatives, he was never his own master for a day. In
      spite of his kingly title, in spite of his despotic theories, he was to
      the last a slave at heart. Villiers treated him like <span class="pagenum">398</span><a
      name="link398" id="link398"></a>one; and this course, though adopted, we
      believe, merely from temper, succeeded as well as if it had been a system
      of policy formed after mature deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In generosity, in sensibility, in capacity for friendship, Essex far
      surpassed Buckingham. Indeed, Buckingham can scarcely be said to have had
      any friend, with the exception of the two princes over whom successively
      he exercised so wonderful an influence. Essex was to the last adored by
      the people. Buckingham was always a most unpopular man, except perhaps for
      a very short time after his return from the childish visit to Spain. Essex
      fell a victim to the rigour of the government amidst the lamentations of
      the people. Buckingham, execrated by the people, and solemnly declared a
      public enemy by the representatives of the people, fell by the hand of one
      of the people, and was lamented by none but his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way in which the two favourites acted towards Bacon was highly
      characteristic, and may serve to illustrate the old and true saying, that
      a man is generally more inclined to feel kindly towards one on whom he has
      conferred favours than towards one from whom he has received them. Essex
      loaded Bacon with benefits, and never thought that he had done enough. It
      seems never to have crossed the mind of the powerful and wealthy noble
      that the poor barrister whom he treated with such munificent kindness was
      not his equal. It was, we have no doubt, with perfect sincerity that the
      Earl declared that he would willingly give his sister or daughter in
      marriage to his friend. He was in general more than sufficiently sensible
      of his own merits; but he did not seem to know that he had ever deserved
      well of Bacon. On that cruel day when they saw each other for the last
      time at the bar of the Lords, Essex <span class="pagenum">399</span><a
      name="link399" id="link399"></a>taxed his perfidious friend with
      unkindness and insincerity, but never with ingratitude. Even in such a
      moment, more bitter than the bitterness of death, that noble heart was too
      great to vent itself in such a reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villiers, on the other hand, owed much to Bacon. When their acquaintance
      began, Sir Francis was a man of mature age, of high station, and of
      established fame as a politician, an advocate, and a writer. Villiers was
      little more than a boy, a younger son of a house then of no great note. He
      was but just entering on the career of court favour; and none but the most
      discerning observers could as yet perceive that he was likely to distance
      all his competitors. The countenance and advice of a man so highly
      distinguished as the Attorney-General must have been an object of the
      highest importance to the young adventurer. But though Villiers was the
      obliged party, he was far less warmly attached to Bacon, and far less
      delicate in his conduct towards Bacon, than Essex had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do the new favourite justice, he early exerted his influence in behalf
      of his illustrious friend. In 1616, Sir Francis was sworn of the Privy
      Council, and in March, 1617, on the retirement of Lord Brackley, was
      appointed Keeper of the Great Seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the seventh of May, the first day of term, he rode in state to
      Westminster Hall, with the Lord Treasurer on his right hand, the Lord
      Privy Seal on his left, a long procession of students and ushers before
      him, and a crowd of peers, privy-councillors, and judges following in his
      train. Having entered his court, he addressed the splendid auditory in a
      grave and dignified speech, which proves how well he understood those
      judicial duties which he afterwards performed so ill. <span class="pagenum">400</span><a
      name="link400" id="link400"></a>Even at that moment, the proudest moment
      of his life in the estimation of the vulgar, and, it may be, even in his
      own, he cast back a look of lingering affection towards those noble
      pursuits from which, as it seemed, he was about to be estranged. &ldquo;The
      depth of the three long vacations,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I would reserve in some
      measure free from business of estate, and for studies, arts, and sciences,
      to which of my own nature I am most inclined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The years during which Bacon held the Great Seal were among the darkest
      and most shameful in English history. Every thing at home and abroad was
      mismanaged. First came the execution of Raleigh, an act which, if done in
      a proper manner, might have been defensible, but which, under all the
      circumstances, must be considered as a dastardly murder. Worse was behind,
      the war of Bohemia, the successes of Tilly and Spinola, the Palatinate
      conquered, the King&rsquo;s son-in-law an exile, the house of Austria dominant
      on the Continent, the Protestant religion and the liberties of the
      Germanic body trodden under foot. Meanwhile, the wavering and cowardly
      policy of England furnished matter of ridicule to all the nations of
      Europe. The love of peace which James professed would, even when indulged
      to an impolitic excess, have been respectable, if it had proceeded from
      tenderness for his people. But the truth is that, while he had nothing to
      spare for the defence of the natural allies of England, he resorted
      without scruple to the most illegal and oppressive devices, for the
      purpose of enabling Buckingham and Buckingham&rsquo;s relations to outshine the
      ancient aristocracy of the realm. Benevolences were exacted. Patents of
      monopoly were multiplied. All the resources which could have been employed
      to replenish a beggared <span class="pagenum">401</span><a name="link401"
       id="link401"></a>Exchequer, at the close of a ruinous war, were put in
      motion during this season of ignominious peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vices of the administration must be chiefly ascribed to the weakness
      of the King and to the levity and violence of the favourite. But it is
      impossible to acquit the Lord Keeper of all share in the guilt. For those
      odious patents, in particular, which passed the Great Seal while it was in
      his charge, he must be held answerable. In the speech which he made on
      first taking his seat in his court, he had pledged himself to discharge
      this important part of his functions with the greatest caution and
      impartiality. He had declared that he &ldquo;would walk in the light, that men
      should see that no particular turn or end led him, but a general rule.&rdquo;
       Mr. Montagu would have us believe that Bacon acted up to these
      professions, and says that &ldquo;the power of the favourite did not deter the
      Lord Keeper from staying grants and patents when his public duty demanded
      this interposition.&rdquo; Does Mr. Montagu consider patents of Monopoly as good
      things? Or does he mean to say that Bacon staid every patent of monopoly
      that came before him? Of all patents in our history, the most disgraceful
      was that which was granted to Sir Giles Mompesson, supposed to be the
      original of Massinger&rsquo;s Overreach, and to Sir Francis Michell, from whom
      Justice Greedy is supposed to have been drawn, for the exclusive
      manufacturing of gold and silver lace. The effect of this monopoly was of
      course that the metal employed in the manufacture was adulterated to the
      great loss of the public. But this was a trifle. The patentees were armed
      with powers as great as have ever been given to farmers of the revenue in
      the worst governed countries. They were authorised to search houses and to
      arrest interlopers; and these formidable <span class="pagenum">402</span><a
      name="link402" id="link402"></a>powers were used for purposes viler than
      even those for which they were given, for the wreaking of old grudges, and
      for the corrupting of female chastity. Was not this a ease in which public
      duty demanded the interposition of the Lord Keeper? And did the Lord
      Keeper interpose? He did. He wrote to inform the King, that he &ldquo;had
      considered of the fitness and conveniency of the gold and silver thread
      business,&rdquo; &ldquo;that it was convenient that it should be settled,&rdquo; that he
      &ldquo;did conceive apparent likelihood that it would redound much to his
      Majesty&rsquo;s profit,&rdquo; that, therefore, &ldquo;it were good it were settled with all
      convenient speed.&rdquo; The meaning of all this was, that certain of the house
      of Villiers were to go shares with Overreach and Greedy in the plunder of
      the public. This was the way in which, when the favourite pressed for
      patents, lucrative to his relations and to his creatures, ruinous and
      vexatious to the body of the people, the chief guardian of the laws
      interposed. Having assisted the patentees to obtain this monopoly, Bacon
      assisted them also in the steps which they took for the purpose of
      guarding it. He committed several people to close confinement for
      disobeying his tyrannical edict. It is needless to say more. Our readers
      are now able to judge whether, in the matter of patents, Bacon acted
      conformably to his professions, or deserved the praise which his
      biographer has bestowed on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his judicial capacity his conduct was not less reprehensible. He
      suffered Buckingham to dictate many of his decisions. Bacon knew as well
      as any man that a judge who listens to private solicitations is a disgrace
      to his post. He had himself, before he was raised to the woolsack,
      represented this strongly to Villiers, then just entering on his career.
      &ldquo;By no <span class="pagenum">403</span><a name="link403" id="link403"></a>means,&rdquo;
       said Sir Francis, in a letter of advice addressed to the young courtier,
      &ldquo;by no means be you persuaded to interpose yourself, either by word or
      letter, in any cause depending in any court of justice, nor suffer any
      great man to do it where you can hinder it. If it should prevail, it
      perverts justice; but, if the judge be so just and of such courage as he
      ought to be, as not to be inclined thereby, yet it always leaves a taint
      of suspicion behind it.&rdquo; Yet he had not been Lord Keeper a month when
      Buckingham began to interfere in Chancery suits; and Buckingham&rsquo;s
      interference was, as might have been expected, successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montagu&rsquo;s reflections on the excellent passage which we have quoted
      above are exceedingly amusing. &ldquo;No man,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;more deeply felt the
      evils which then existed of the interference of the Crown and of statesmen
      to influence judges. How beautifully did he admonish Buckingham,
      regardless as he proved of all admonition!&rdquo; We should be glad to know how
      it can be expected that admonition will be regarded by him who receives
      it, when it is altogether neglected by him who gives it. We do not defend
      Buckingham: but what was his guilt to Bacon&rsquo;s? Buckingham was young,
      ignorant, thoughtless, dizzy with the rapidity of his ascent and the
      height of his position. That he should be eager to serve his relations,
      his flatterers, his mistresses, that he should not fully apprehend the
      immense importance of a pure administration of justice, that he should
      think more about those who were bound to him by private ties than about
      the public interest, all this was perfectly natural, and not altogether
      unpardonable. Those who intrust a petulant, hot-blooded, ill-informed lad
      with power, are more to blame, than he for the mischief which he may do
      with <span class="pagenum">404</span><a name="link404" id="link404"></a>it.
      How could it be expected of a lively page, raised by a wild freak of
      fortune to the first influence in the empire, that he should have bestowed
      any serious thought on the principles which ought to guide judicial
      decisions? Bacon was the ablest public man then living in Europe. He was
      near sixty years old. He had thought much, and to good purpose, on the
      general principles of law. He had for many years borne a part daily in the
      administration of justice. It was impossible that a man with a tithe of
      his sagacity and experience should not have known that a judge who suffers
      friends or patrons to dictate his decrees violates the plainest rules of
      duty. In fact, as we have seen, he knew this well: he expressed it
      admirably. Neither on this occasion nor on any other could his bad actions
      be attributed to any defect of the head. They sprang from quite a
      different cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man who stooped to render such services to others was not likely to be
      scrupulous as to the means by which he enriched himself. He and his
      dependents accepted large presents from persons who were engaged in
      Chancery suits. The amount of the plunder which he collected in this way
      it is impossible to estimate. There can be no doubt that he received very
      much more than was proved on his trial, though, it may be, less than was
      suspected by the public. His enemies stated his illicit gains at a hundred
      thousand pounds. But this was probably an exaggeration.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long before the day of reckoning arrived. During the interval
      between the second and third Parliaments of James, the nation was
      absolutely governed by the Crown. The prospects of the Lord Keeper were
      bright and serene. His great place rendered the <span class="pagenum">405</span><a
      name="link405" id="link405"></a>splendour of his talents even more
      conspicuous, and gave an additional charm to the serenity of his temper,
      the courtesy of his manners, and the eloquence of his conversation. The
      pillaged suitor might mutter. The austere Puritan patriot might, in his
      retreat, grieve that one on whom God had bestowed without measure all the
      abilities which qualify men to take the lead in great reforms should be
      found among the adherents of the worst abuses. But the murmurs of the
      suitor and the lamentations of the patriot had scarcely any avenue to the
      ears of the powerful. The King, and the minister who was the King&rsquo;s
      master, smiled on their illustrious flatterer. The whole crowd of
      courtiers and nobles sought his favour with emulous eagerness. Men of wit
      and learning hailed with delight the elevation of one who had so signally
      shown that a man of profound learning and of brilliant wit might
      understand, far better than any plodding dunce, the art of thriving in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, and but once, this course of prosperity was for a moment
      interrupted. It should seem that even Bacon&rsquo;s brain was not strong enough
      to bear without some discomposure the inebriating effect of so much good
      fortune. For some time after his elevation, he showed himself a little
      wanting in that wariness and self-command to which, more than even to his
      transcendent talents, his elevation was to be ascribed. He was by no means
      a good hater. The temperature of his revenge, like that of his gratitude,
      was scarcely ever more than lukewarm. But there was one person whom he had
      long regarded with an animosity which, though studiously suppressed, was
      perhaps the stronger for the suppression. The insults and injuries which,
      when a young man struggling into note and professional practice, <span
      class="pagenum">406</span><a name="link406" id="link406"></a>he had
      received from Sir Edward Coke, were such as might move the most placable
      nature to resentment. About the time at which Bacon received the Seals,
      Coke had, on account of his contumacious resistance to the royal pleasure,
      been deprived of his seat in the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench, and had ever since
      languished in retirement. But Coke&rsquo;s opposition to the Court, we fear, was
      the effect not of good principles, but of a bad temper. Perverse and testy
      as he was, he wanted true fortitude and dignity of character. His
      obstinacy, unsupported by virtuous motives, was not proof against
      disgrace. He solicited a reconciliation with the favourite, and his
      solicitations were successful. Sir John Villiers, the brother of
      Buckingham, was looking out for a rich wife. Coke had a large fortune and
      an unmarried daughter. A bargain was struck. But Lady Coke, the lady whom
      twenty years before Essex had wooed on behalf of Bacon, would not hear of
      the match. A violent and scandalous family quarrel followed. The mother
      carried the girl away by stealth. The father pursued them and regained
      possession of his daughter by force. The King was then in Scotland, and
      Buckingham had attended him thither. Bacon was, during their absence, at
      the head of affairs in England. He felt towards Coke as much malevolence
      as it was in his nature to feel towards any body. His wisdom had been laid
      to sleep by prosperity. In an evil hour he determined to interfere in the
      disputes which agitated his enemy&rsquo;s household. He declared for the wife,
      countenanced the Attorney-General in filing an information in the Star
      Chamber against the husband, and wrote letters to the King and the
      favourite against the proposed marriage. The strong language which he used
      in those letters shows that, sagacious <span class="pagenum">407</span><a
      name="link407" id="link407"></a>as he was, he did not quite know his
      place, and that he was not fully acquainted with the extent either of
      Buckingham&rsquo;s power, or of the change which the possession of that power
      had produced in Buckingham&rsquo;s character. He soon had a lesson which he
      never forgot. The favourite received the news of the Lord Keeper&rsquo;s
      interference with feelings of the most violent resentment, and made the
      King even more angry than himself. Bacon&rsquo;s eyes were at once opened to his
      error, and to all its possible consequences. He had been elated, if not
      intoxicated, by greatness. The shock sobered him in an instant. He was all
      himself again. He apologized submissively for his interference. He
      directed the Attorney-General to stop the proceedings against Coke. He
      sent to tell Lady Coke that he could do nothing for her. He announced to
      both the families that he was desirous to promote the connection. Having
      given these proofs of contrition, he ventured to present himself before
      Buckingham. But the young upstart did not think that he had yet
      sufficiently humbled an old man who had been his friend and his
      benefactor, who was the highest civil functionary in the realm, and the
      most eminent man of letters in the world. It is said that on two
      successive days Bacon repaired to Buckingham&rsquo;s house, that on two
      successive days he was suffered to remain in an antechamber among
      foot-boys, seated on an old wooden box, with the Great Seal of England at
      his side, and that when at length he was admitted, he flung himself on the
      floor, kissed the favourite&rsquo;s feet, and vowed never to rise till he was
      forgiven. Sir Anthony Weldon, on whose authority this story rests, is
      likely enough to have exaggerated the meanness of Bacon and the insolence
      of Buckingham. But it is difficult to imagine <span class="pagenum">408</span><a
      name="link408" id="link408"></a>that so circumstantial a narrative,
      written by a person who avers that he was present on the occasion, can be
      wholly without foundation; and, unhappily, there is little in the
      character either of the favourite or of the Lord Keeper to make the
      narrative improbable. It is certain that a reconciliation took place on
      terms humiliating to Bacon, who never more ventured to cross any purpose
      of any body who bore the name of Villiers. He put a strong curb on those
      angry passions which had for the first time in his life mastered his
      prudence. He went through the forms of a reconciliation with Coke, and did
      his best, by seeking opportunities of paying little civilities, and by
      avoiding all that could produce collision, to tame the untameable ferocity
      of his old enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the main, however, Bacon&rsquo;s life, while he held the Great Seal, was, in
      outward appearance, most enviable. In London he lived with great dignity
      at York House, the venerable mansion of his father. Here it was that, in
      January, 1620, he celebrated his entrance into his sixtieth year amidst a
      splendid circle of friends. He had then exchanged the appellation of
      Keeper for the higher title of Chancellor. Ben Jonson was one of the
      party, and wrote on the occasion some of the happiest of his rugged
      rhymes. All things, he tells us, seemed to smile about the old house, &ldquo;the
      fire, the wine, the men.&rdquo; The spectacle of the accomplished host, after a
      life marked by no great disaster, entering on a green old age, in the
      enjoyment of riches, power, high honours, undiminished mental activity,
      and vast literary reputation, made a strong impression on the <span
      class="pagenum">409</span><a name="link409" id="link409"></a>poet, if we
      may judge from those well-known lines; <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"England&rsquo;s
      high Chancellor, the destined heir, <br /><span class="indent20">In his
      soft cradle, to his father&rsquo;s chair.&rdquo; <br /><br /><span class="indent20">Whose
      even thread the Fates spin round and full <br /><span class="indent20">Out
      of their choicest and their whitest wool.&rdquo; </span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In the intervals of rest which Bacon&rsquo;s political and judicial functions
      afforded, he was in the habit of retiring to Gorhambury. At that place his
      business was literature, and his favourite amusement gardening, which in
      one of his most interesting Essays he calls &ldquo;the purest of human
      pleasures.&rdquo; In his magnificent grounds, he erected, at a cost of ten
      thousand pounds, a retreat to which he repaired when he wished to avoid
      all visitors, and to devote himself wholly to study. On such occasions, a
      few young men of distinguished talents were sometimes the companions of
      his retirement; and among them his quick eye soon discerned the superior
      abilities of Thomas Hobbes. It is not probable however, that he fully
      appreciated the powers of his disciple, or foresaw the vast influence,
      both for good and for evil, which that most vigorous and acute of human
      intellects was destined to exercise on the two succeeding generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In January, 1621, Bacon had reached the zenith of his fortunes. He had
      just published the <i>Novum Organum</i>; and that extraordinary book had
      drawn forth the warmest expressions of admiration from the ablest men in
      Europe. He had obtained honours of a widely different kind, but perhaps
      not less valued by him. He had been created Baron Verulam. He had
      subsequently been raised to the higher dignity of Viscount St. Albans. His
      patent was drawn in the most flattering terms, and the Prince of Wales
      signed it as a witness. The ceremony of investiture was performed with
      great state at Theobalds, and Buckingham condescended to be one of the
      chief actors. Posterity has felt that the greatest of English philosophers
      could derive <span class="pagenum">410</span><a name="link410" id="link410"></a>no
      accession of dignity from any title which James could bestow, and, in
      defiance of the royal letters patent, has obstinately refused to degrade
      Francis Bacon into Viscount St. Albans.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few weeks was signally brought to the test the value of those objects
      for which Bacon had sullied his integrity, had resigned his independence,
      had violated the most sacred obligations of friendship and gratitude, had
      flattered the worthless, had persecuted the innocent, had tampered with
      judges, had tortured prisoners, had plundered suitors, had wasted on
      paltry intrigues, all the powers of the most exquisitely constructed
      intellect that has ever been bestowed on any of the children of men. A
      sudden and terrible reverse was at hand. A Parliament had been summoned.
      After six years of silence the voice of the nation was attain to be heard.
      Only three days after the pageant which was performed at Theobalds in
      honour of Bacon, the Houses met.
    </p>
    <p>
      Want of money had, as usual, induced the King to convoke his Parliament.
      It may be doubted, however, whether, if he or his ministers had been at
      all aware of the state of public feeling, they would not have tried any
      expedient, or borne with any inconvenience, rather than have ventured to
      face the deputies of a justly exasperated nation. But they did not discern
      those times. Indeed almost all the political blunders of James, and of his
      more unfortunate son, arose from one great error. During the fifty years
      which preceded the Long Parliament, a great and progressive change was
      taking place in the public mind. The nature and extent of this change was
      not in the least understood by either of the first two Kings of the House
      of Stuart, or by any of their advisers. That the nation became more and
      more discontented every year, that every House of <span class="pagenum">411</span><a
      name="link411" id="link411"></a>Commons was more unmanageable than that
      which had preceded it, were facts which it was impossible not to perceive.
      But the Court could not understand why these things were so. The Court
      could not see that the English people and the English Government, though
      they might once have been well suited to each other, were suited to each
      other no longer; that the nation had outgrown its old institutions, was
      every day more uneasy under them, was pressing against them, and would
      soon burst through them. The alarming phænomena, the existence of which no
      sycophant could deny, were ascribed to every cause except the true one.
      &ldquo;In my first Parliament,&rdquo; said James, &ldquo;I was a novice. In my next, there
      was a kind of beasts called undertakers,&rdquo; and so forth. In the third
      Parliament he could hardly be called a novice, and those beasts, the
      undertakers, did not exist. Yet his third Parliament gave him more trouble
      than either the first or the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Parliament had no sooner met than the House of Commons proceeded, in a
      temperate and respectful, but most determined manner, to discuss the
      public grievances. Their first attacks were directed against those odious
      patents, under cover of which Buckingham and his creatures had pillaged
      and oppressed the nation. The vigour with which these proceedings were
      conducted spread dismay through the Court. Buckingham thought himself in
      danger, and, in his alarm, had recourse to an adviser who had lately
      acquired considerable influence over him, Williams, Dean of Westminster.
      This person had already been of great use to the favourite in a very
      delicate matter. Buckingham had set his heart on marrying Lady Catherine
      Manners, daughter and heiress of the Earl of Rutland. But the difficulties
      were great. The Earl <span class="pagenum">412</span><a name="link412"
       id="link412"></a>was haughty and impracticable, and the young lady was a
      Catholic. Williams soothed the pride of the father, and found arguments
      which, for a time at least, quieted the conscience of the daughter. For
      these services he had been rewarded with considerable preferment in the
      Church; and he was now rapidly rising to the same place in the regard of
      Buckingham which had formerly been occupied by Bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Williams was one of those who are wiser for others than for themselves.
      His own public life was unfortunate, and was made unfortunate by his
      strange want of judgment and self-command at several important
      conjunctures. But the counsel which he gave on this occasion showed no
      want of worldly wisdom. He advised the favourite to abandon all thoughts
      of defending the monopolies, to find some foreign embassy for his brother
      Sir Edward, who was deeply implicated in the villanies of Mompesson, and
      to leave the other offenders to the justice of Parliament. Buckingham
      received this advice with the warmest expressions of gratitude, and
      declared that a load had been lifted from his heart. He then repaired with
      Williams to the royal presence. They found the King engaged in earnest
      consultation with Prince Charles. The plan of operations proposed by the
      Dean was fully discussed, and approved in all its parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first victims whom the Court abandoned to the vengeance of the Commons
      were Sir Giles Mompesson and Sir Francis Michell. It was some time before
      Bacon began to entertain any apprehensions. His talents and his address
      gave him great influence in the house of which he had lately become a
      member, as indeed they must have in any assembly. In the House of Commons
      he had many personal friends and many <span class="pagenum">413</span><a
      name="link413" id="link413"></a>warm admirers. But at length, about six
      weeks after the meeting of Parliament, the storm burst.
    </p>
    <p>
      A committee of the lower House had been appointed to inquire into the
      state of the Courts of Justice. On the fifteenth of March the chairman of
      that committee, Sir Robert Philips, member for Bath, reported that great
      abuses had been discovered. &ldquo;The person,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;against whom these
      things are alleged is no less than the Lord Chancellor, a man so endued
      with all parts, both of nature and art, as that I will say no more of him,
      being not able to say enough.&rdquo; Sir Robert then proceeded to state, in the
      most temperate manner, the nature of the charges. A person of the name of
      Aubrey had a case depending in Chancery. He had been almost ruined by
      law-expenses, and his patience had been exhausted by the delays of the
      court. He received a hint from some of the hangers-on of the Chancellor
      that a present of one hundred pounds would expedite matters. The poor man
      had not the sum required. However, having found out an usurer who
      accommodated him with it at high interest, he carried it to York House.
      The Chancellor took the money, and his dependents assured the suitor that
      all would go right. Aubrey was, however, disappointed; for, after
      considerable delay, &ldquo;a killing decree&rdquo; was pronounced against him. Another
      suitor of the name of Egerton complained that he had been induced by two
      of the Chancellor&rsquo;s jackals to make his Lordship a present of four hundred
      pounds, and that, nevertheless, he had not been able to obtain a decree in
      his favour. The evidence to these facts was overwhelming. Bacon&rsquo;s friends
      could only entreat the House to suspend its judgment, and to send up the
      case to the Lords, in a form less offensive than an impeachment. <span
      class="pagenum">414</span><a name="link414" id="link414"></a>On the
      nineteenth of March the King; sent a message to the Commons, expressing
      his deep regret that so eminent a person as the Chancellor should be
      suspected of misconduct. His Majesty declared that he had no wish to
      screen the guilty from justice, and proposed to appoint a new kind of
      tribunal, consisting of eighteen commissioners, who might be chosen from
      among the members of the two Houses, to investigate the matter. The
      Commons were not disposed to depart from their regular course of
      proceeding. On the same day they held a conference with the Lords, and
      delivered in the heads of the accusation against the Chancellor. At this
      conference Bacon was not present. Overwhelmed with shame and remorse, and
      abandoned by all those in whom he had weakly put his trust, he had shut
      himself up in his chamber from the eyes of men. The dejection of his mind
      soon disordered his body. Buckingham, who visited him by the King&rsquo;s order,
      &ldquo;found his Lordship very sick and heavy.&rdquo; It appears from a pathetic
      letter which the unhappy man addressed to the Peers on the day of the
      conference, that he neither expected nor wished to survive his disgrace.
      During several days he remained in his bed, refusing to see any human
      being. He passionately told his attendants to leave him, to forget him,
      never again to name his name, never to remember that there had been such a
      man in the world. In the mean time, fresh instances of corruption were
      every day brought to the knowledge of his accusers. The number of charges
      rapidly increased from two to twenty-three. The Lords entered on the
      investigation of the case with laudable alacrity. Some witnesses were
      examined at the bar of the House. A select committee was appointed to take
      the depositions <span class="pagenum">415</span><a name="link415"
       id="link415"></a>of others; and the inquiry was rapidly proceeding, when,
      on the twenty-sixth of March, the King adjourned the Parliament for three
      weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      This measure revived Bacon&rsquo;s hopes. He made the most of his short respite.
      He attempted to work on the feeble mind of the King. He appealed to all
      the strongest feelings of James, to his fears, to his vanity, to his high
      notions of prerogative. Would the Solomon of the age commit so gross an
      error as to encourage the encroaching spirit of Parliaments? Would God&rsquo;s
      anointed, accountable to God alone, pay homage to the clamorous multitude?
      &ldquo;Those,&rdquo; exclaimed Bacon, &ldquo;who now strike at the Chancellor will soon
      strike at the Crown. I am the first sacrifice. I wish I may be the last.&rdquo;
       But all his eloquence and address were employed in vain. Indeed, whatever
      Mr. Montagu may say, we are firmly convinced that it was not in the King&rsquo;s
      power to save Bacon, without having recourse to measures which would have
      convulsed the realm. The Crown had not sufficient influence over the
      Parliament to procure an acquittal in so clear a case of guilt. And to
      dissolve a Parliament which is universally allowed to have been one of the
      best Parliaments that ever sat, which had acted liberally and respectfully
      towards the Sovereign, and which enjoyed in the highest degree the favour
      of the people, only in order to stop a grave, temperate, and
      constitutional inquiry into the personal integrity of the first judge in
      the kingdom, would have been a measure more scandalous and absurd than any
      of those which were the ruin of the House of Stuart. Such a measure, while
      it would have been as fatal to the Chancellor&rsquo;s honour as a conviction,
      would have endangered the very existence of the monarchy. The <span
      class="pagenum">416</span><a name="link416" id="link416"></a>King, acting
      by the advice of Williams, very properly refused to engage in a dangerous
      struggle with his people, for the purpose of saving from legal
      condemnation a minister whom it was impossible to save from dishonour. He
      advised Bacon to plead guilty, and promised to do all in his power to
      mitigate the punishment. Mr. Montagu is exceedingly angry with James on
      this account. But though we are, in general, very little inclined to
      admire that Prince&rsquo;s conduct, we really think that his advice was, under
      all the circumstances, the best advice that could have been given.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the seventeenth of April the Houses reassembled, and the Lords resumed
      their inquiries into the abuses of the Court of Chancery. On the
      twenty-second, Bacon addressed to the Peers a letter, which the Prince of
      Wales condescended to deliver. In this artful and pathetic composition,
      the Chancellor acknowledged his guilt in guarded and general texans, and,
      while acknowledging, endeavoured to palliate it. This, however, was not
      thought sufficient by his judges. They required a more particular
      confession, and sent him a copy of the charges. On the thirtieth, he
      delivered a paper in which he admitted, with few and unimportant
      reservations, the truth of the accusations brought against him, and threw
      himself entirely on the mercy of his peers. &ldquo;Upon advised consideration of
      the charges,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;descending into my own conscience, and calling my
      memory to account so far as I am able, I do plainly and ingenuously
      confess that I am guilty of corruption, and do renounce all defence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lords came to a resolution that the Chancellor&rsquo;s confession appeared
      to be full and ingenuous, and sent a committee to inquire of him whether
      it was <span class="pagenum">417</span><a name="link417" id="link417"></a>really
      subscribed by himself. The deputies, among whom was Southampton, the
      common friend, many years before, of Bacon and Essex, performed their duty
      with great delicacy. Indeed the agonies of such a mind and the degradation
      of such a name might well have softened the most obdurate natures. &ldquo;My
      Lords,&rdquo; said Bacon, &ldquo;it is my act, my hand, my heart. I beseech your
      Lordships to be merciful to a broken reed.&rdquo; They withdrew; and he again
      retired to his chamber in the deepest dejection. The next day, the
      sergeant-at-arms and the usher of the House of Lords came to conduct him
      to Westminster Hall, where sentence was to be pronounced. But they found
      him so unwell that he could not leave his bed; and this excuse for his
      absence was readily accepted. In no quarter does there appear to have been
      the smallest desire to add to his humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentence was, however, severe, the more severe, no doubt, because the
      Lords knew that it would not be executed, and that they had an excellent
      opportunity of exhibiting, at small cost, the inflexibility of their
      justice, and their abhorrence of corruption. Bacon was condemned to pay a
      fine of forty thousand pounds, and to be imprisoned in the Tower during
      the King&rsquo;s pleasure. He was declared incapable of holding any office in
      the State or of sitting in Parliament; and he was banished for life from
      the verge of the court. In such misery and shame ended that long career of
      worldly wisdom and worldly prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at this pass Mr. Montagu does not desert his hero. He seems indeed to
      think that the attachment of an editor ought to be as devoted as that of
      Mr. Moore&rsquo;s lovers; and cannot conceive what biography <span
      class="pagenum">418</span><a name="link418" id="link418"></a>was made for,
      <br /><br /><span class="indent30">"if &rsquo;tis not the same <br /><span
      class="indent15">Through joy and through torment, through glory and
      shame.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He assures us that Bacon was innocent, that, he had the means of making a
      perfectly satisfactory defence, that when he &ldquo;plainly and ingenuously
      confessed that he was guilty of corruption,&rdquo; and when he afterwards
      solemnly affirmed that his confession was &ldquo;his act, his hand, his heart,&rdquo;
       he was telling a great lie, and that he refrained from bringing forward
      proofs of his innocence, because he durst not disobey the King and the
      favourite, who, for his own selfish objects, pressed him to plead guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in the first place, there is not the smallest reason to believe that,
      if James and Buckingham had thought that Bacon had a good defence, they
      would have prevented him from making it. What conceivable motive had they
      for doing so? Mr. Montagu perpetually repeats that it was their interest
      to sacrifice Bacon. But he overlooks an obvious distinction. It was their
      interest to sacrifice Bacon on the supposition of his guilt; but not on
      the supposition of his innocence. James was very properly unwilling to run
      the risk of protecting his Chancellor against the Parliament. But if the
      Chancellor had been able, by force of argument, to obtain an acquittal
      from the Parliament, we have no doubt that both the King and Villiers
      would have heartily rejoiced. They would have rejoiced, not merely on
      account of their friendship for Bacon, which seems, however, to have been
      as sincere as most friendships of that sort, but on selfish grounds.
      Nothing could have strengthened the government more than such a victory.
      The King and the favourite abandoned the Chancellor because they were
      unable to avert his disgrace, and unwilling to share it. Mr. Montagu
      mistakes effect for cause. <span class="pagenum">419</span><a
      name="link419" id="link419"></a>He thinks that Bacon did not prove his
      innocence, because he was not supported by the Court. The truth evidently
      is that the Court did not venture to support Bacon, because he could not
      prove his innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, it seems strange that Mr. Montagu should not perceive that, while
      attempting to vindicate Bacon&rsquo;s reputation, he is really casting on it the
      foulest of all aspersions. He imputes to his idol a degree of meanness and
      depravity more loathsome than judicial corruption itself. A corrupt judge
      may have many good qualities. But a man who, to please a powerful patron,
      solemnly declares himself guilty of corruption when he knows himself to be
      innocent, must be a monster of servility and impudence. Bacon was, to say
      nothing of his highest claims to respect, a gentleman, a nobleman, a
      scholar, a statesman, a man of the first consideration in society, a man
      far advanced in years. Is it possible to believe that such a man would, to
      gratify any human being, irreparably ruin his own character by his own
      act? Imagine a grey-headed judge, frill of years and honours, owning with
      tears, with pathetic assurances of his penitence and of his sincerity,
      that he has been guilty of shameful mal-practices, repeatedly asseverating
      the truth of his confession, subscribing it with his own band, submitting
      to conviction, receiving a humiliating sentence and acknowledging its
      justice, and all this when he has it in his power to show that his conduct
      has been irreproachable! The thing is incredible. But if we admit it to be
      true, what must we think of such a man, if indeed be deserves the name of
      man, who thinks any thing that kings and minions can bestow more precious
      than honour, or any thing that they can inflict more terrible than infamy?
      <span class="pagenum">420</span><a name="link420" id="link420"></a>Of this
      most disgraceful imputation we fully acquit Bacon. He had no defence; and
      Mr. Montagu&rsquo;s affectionate attempt to make a defence for him has
      altogether failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grounds on which Mr. Montagu rests the case are two; the first, that
      the taking of presents was usual, and, what he seems to consider as the
      same thing, not discreditable; the second, that these presents were not
      taken as bribes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montagu brings forward many facts in support of his first proposition.
      He is not content with showing that many English judges formerly received
      gifts from suitors, but collects similar instances from foreign nations
      and ancient times. He goes back to the commonwealths of Greece, and
      attempts to press into his service a line of Homer and a sentence of
      Plutarch, which, we fear, will hardly serve his turn. The gold of which
      Homer speaks was not intended to fee the judges, but was paid into court
      for the benefit of the successful litigant; and the gratuities which
      Pericles, as Plutarch states, distributed among the members of the
      Athenian tribunals, were legal wages paid out of the public revenue. We
      can supply Mr. Montagu with passages much more in point. Hesiod, who like
      poor Aubrey, had a &ldquo;killing decree&rdquo; made against him in the Chancery of
      Ascra, forgot decorum so far that he ventured to designate the learned
      persons who presided in that court, as [Greek] Plutarch and Diodorus have
      handed down to the latest ages the respectable name of Anytus, the son of
      Anthemion, the first defendant who, eluding all the safeguards which the
      ingenuity of Solon could devise, succeeded in corrupting a bench of
      Athenian judges. We are indeed so far from grudging Mr. Montagu the aid of
      Greece, that we will <span class="pagenum">421</span><a name="link421"
       id="link421"></a>give him Rome into the bargain. We acknowledge that the
      honourable senators who tried Verres received presents which were worth
      more than the fee-simple of York House and Gorhambury together, and that
      the no less honorable senators and knights who professed to believe in the
      <i>alibi</i> of Clodius obtained marks still more extraordinary of the
      esteem and gratitude of the defendant. In short, we are ready to admit
      that, before Bacon&rsquo;s time, and in Bacon&rsquo;s time, judges were in the habit
      of receiving gifts from suitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      But is this a defence? We think not. The robberies of Cacus and Barabbas
      are no apology for those of Turpin. The conduct of the two men of Belial
      who swore away the life of Naboth has never been cited as an excuse for
      the perjuries of Oates and Dangerfield. Mr. Montagu has confounded two
      things which it is necessary carefully to distinguish from each other, if
      we wish to form a correct judgment of the characters of men of other
      countries and other times. That an immoral action is, in a particular
      society, generally considered as innocent, is a good plea for an
      individual who, being one of that society, and having adopted the notions
      which prevail among his neighbors, commits that action. But the
      circumstance that a great many people are in the habit of committing
      immoral actions is no plea at all. We should think it unjust to call St.
      Louis a wicked man, because in an age in which toleration was generally
      regarded as a sin, he persecuted heretics. We should think it unjust to
      call Cowper&rsquo;s friend, John Newton, a hypocrite and monster, because at a
      time when the slave-trade was commonly considered by the most respectable
      people as an innocent and beneficial traffic, he went, largely provided
      with hymn-books and handcuffs on a Guinea <span class="pagenum">422</span><a
      name="link422" id="link422"></a>voyage. But the circumstance that there
      are twenty thousand thieves in London, is no excuse for a fellow who is
      caught breaking into a shop. No man is to be blamed for not making
      discoveries in morality, for not finding out that something which
      everybody else thinks to be good is really bad. But, if a man does that
      which he and all around him know to be bad, it is no excuse for him that
      many others have done the same. We should be ashamed of spending so much
      time in pointing out so clear a distinction, but that Mr. Montagu seems
      altogether to overlook it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now to apply these principles to the case before us; let Mr. Montagu prove
      that, in Bacon&rsquo;s age, the practices for which Bacon was punished were
      generally considered as innocent; and we admit that he has made out his
      point. But this we defy him to do. That these practices were common we
      admit. But they were common just as all wickedness to which there is
      strong temptation always was and always will be common. They were common
      just as theft, cheating, perjury, adultery have always been common. They
      were common, not because people did not know what was right, but because
      people liked to do what was wrong. They were common, though prohibited by
      law. They were common, though condemned by public opinion. They were
      common, because in that age law and public opinion united had not
      sufficient force to restrain the greediness of powerful and unprincipled
      magistrates. They were common, as every crime will be common when the gain
      to which it leads is great, and the chance of punishment small. But,
      though common, they were universally allowed to be altogether
      unjustifiable; they were in the highest degree odious; and, though many
      were guilty of them, none had the audacity publicly to avow and defend
      them. <span class="pagenum">423</span><a name="link423" id="link423"></a>We
      could give a thousand proofs that the opinion then entertained concerning
      these practices was such as we have described. But we will content
      ourselves with calling; a single witness, honest Hugh Latimer. His
      sermons, preached more than seventy years before the inquiry into Bacon&rsquo;s
      conduct, abound with the sharpest invectives against those very practices
      of which Bacon was guilty, and which, as Mr. Montagu seems to think,
      nobody ever considered as blamable till Bacon was punished for them. We
      could easily fill twenty pages with the homely, but just and forcible
      rhetoric of the brave old bishop. We shall select a few passages as fair
      specimens, and no more than fair specimens of the rest. &ldquo;<i>Omnes diligunt
      munera</i>. They all love bribes. Bribery is a princely kind of thieving.
      They will be waged by the rich, either to give sentence against the poor,
      or to put off the poor man&rsquo;s cause. This is the noble theft of princes and
      magistrates. They are bribe-takers. Nowadays they call them gentle
      rewards. Let them leave their colouring, and call them by their Christian
      name&mdash;bribes.&rdquo; And again; &ldquo;Cambyses was a great emperor, such another
      as our master is. He had many lord deputies, lord presidents, and
      lieutenants under him. It is a great while ago since I read the history.
      It chanced he had under him in one of his dominions a briber, a
      gift-taker, a gratifier of rich men; he followed gifts as fast as he that
      followed the pudding, a handmaker in his office to make his son a great
      man, as the old saying is: Happy is the child whose father goeth to the
      devil. The cry of the poor widow came to the emperor&rsquo;s ear, and caused him
      to flay the judge quick, and laid his skin in the chair of judgment, that
      all judges that should give judgment afterward should sit in the same
      skin. Surely it was <span class="pagenum">424</span><a name="link424"
       id="link424"></a>a goodly sign, a goodly monument, the sign of the judge&rsquo;s
      skin. I pray God we may once see the skin in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; says he in another sermon, &ldquo;this is <i>scala inferni</i>, the
      right way to hell, to be covetous, to take bribes, and pervert justice. If
      a judge should ask me the way to hell, I would show him this way. First,
      let him be a covetous man; let his heart be poisoned with covetousness.
      Then let him go a little further and take bribes; and, lastly, pervert
      judgment. Lo, here is the mother, and the daughter, and the daughter&rsquo;s
      daughter. Avarice is the mother: she brings forth bribe-taking, and
      bribe-taking perverting of judgment. There lacks a fourth thing to make up
      the mess, which, so help me God, if I were judge, should be <i>hanyum tuum</i>,
      a Tyburn tippet to take with him; an it were the judge of the King&rsquo;s
      Bench, my Lord Chief Judge of England, yea, an it were my Lord Chancellor
      himself, to Tyburn with him.&rdquo; We will quote but one more passage. &ldquo;He that
      took the silver basin and ewer for a bribe, thinketh that it will never
      come out. But he may now know that I know it, and I know it not alone;
      there be more beside me that know it. Oh, briber and bribery! He was never
      a good man that will so take bribes. Nor can I believe that he that is a
      briber will be a good justice. It will never be merry in England till we
      have the skins of such. For what needeth bribing where men do their things
      uprightly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not the language of a great philosopher who had made new
      discoveries in moral and political science. It was the plain talk of a
      plain man, who sprang from the body of the people, who sympathised
      strongly with their wants and their feelings, and who boldly uttered their
      opinions. It was on account of the <span class="pagenum">425</span><a
      name="link425" id="link425"></a>fearless way in which stout-hearted old
      Hugh exposed the misdeeds of men in ermine tippets and gold collars, that
      the Londoners cheered him, as he walked down the Strand to preach at
      Whitehall, struggled for a touch of his gown, and bawled &ldquo;Have at them,
      Father Latimer.&rdquo; It is plain, from the passages which we have quoted, and
      from fifty others winch we might quote, that, long before Bacon was born,
      the accepting of presents by a judge was known to be a wicked and shameful
      act, that the fine words under which it was the fashion to veil such
      corrupt practices were even then seen through by the common people, that
      the distinction on which Mr. Montagu insists between compliments and
      bribes was even then laughed at as a mere colouring. There may be some
      oratorical exaggeration in what Latimer says about the Tyburn tippet and
      the sign of the judge&rsquo;s skin; but the fact that he ventured to use such
      expressions is amply sufficient to prove that the gift-taking judges, the
      receivers of silver basins and ewers, were regarded as such pests of the
      commonwealth that a venerable divine might, without any breach of
      Christian charity, publicly pray to God for their detection and their
      condign punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montagu tells us, most justly, that we ought not to transfer the
      opinions of our age to a former age. But he has himself committed a
      greater error than that against which he has cautioned his readers.
      Without any evidence, nay, in the face of the strongest evidence, he
      ascribes to the people of a former age a set of opinions which no people
      ever held. But any hypothesis is in his view more probable than that Bacon
      should have been a dishonest man. We firmly believe that, if papers were
      to be discovered which should irresistibly prove that Bacon was concerned
      in the poisoning of <span class="pagenum">426</span><a name="link426"
       id="link426"></a>Sir Thomas Overbury, Mr. Montagu would tell us that, at
      the beginning of the seventeenth century, it was not thought improper in a
      man to put arsenic into the broth of his friends, and that we ought to
      blame, not Bacon, but the age in which he lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why should we have recourse to any other evidence, when the proceeding
      against Lord Bacon is itself the best evidence on the subject? When Mr.
      Montagu tells us that we ought not to transfer the opinions of our age to
      Bacon&rsquo;s age, he appears altogether to forget that it was by men of Bacon&rsquo;s
      own age that Bacon was prosecuted, tried, convicted, and sentenced. Did
      not they know what their own opinions were? Did not they know whether they
      thought the taking of gifts by a judge a crime or not? Mr. Montagu
      complains bitterly that Bacon was induced to abstain from making a
      defence. But, if Bacon&rsquo;s defence resembled that which is made for him in
      the volume before us, it would have been unnecessary to trouble the Houses
      with it. The Lords and Commons did not want Bacon to tell them the
      thoughts of their own hearts, to inform them that they did not consider
      such practices as those in which they had detected him as at all culpable.
      Mr. Montagu&rsquo;s proposition may indeed be fairly stated thus:&mdash;It was
      very hard that Bacon&rsquo;s contemporaries should think it wrong in him to do
      what thev did not think it wrong in him to do. Third indeed; and withal
      somewhat improbable. Will any person say that the Commons who impeached
      Bacon for taking presents, and the Lords who sentenced him to fine,
      imprisonment, and degradation for taking presents, did not know that the
      taking of presents was a crime? Or, will any person say that Bacon did not
      know what the whole House of Commons and the <span class="pagenum">427</span><a
      name="link427" id="link427"></a>whole House of Lords knew? Nobody who is
      not prepared to maintain one of these absurd propositions can deny that
      Bacon committed what he knew to be a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be pretended that the Houses were seeking occasion to ruin
      Bacon, and that they therefore brought him to punishment on charges which
      they themselves knew to be frivolous. In no quarter was there the faintest
      indication of a disposition to treat him harshly. Through the whole
      proceeding there was no symptom of personal animosity or of factious
      violence in either House. Indeed, we will venture to say that no
      State-Trial in our history is more creditable to all who took part in it,
      either as prosecutors or judges. The decency, the gravity, the public
      spirit, the justice moderated but not unnerved by compassion, which
      appeared in every part of the transaction, would do honour to the most
      respectable public men in our own times. The accusers, while they
      discharged their duty to their constituents by bringing the misdeeds of
      the Chancellor to light, spoke with admiration of his many eminent
      qualities. The Lords, while condemning him, complimented him on the
      ingenuousness of his confession, and spared him the humiliation of a
      public appearance at their bar. So strong was the contagion of good
      feeling that even Sir Edward Coke, for the first time in his life, behaved
      like a gentleman. No criminal ever had more temperate prosecutors than
      Bacon. No criminal ever had more favourable judges. If he was convicted,
      it was because it was impossible to acquit him without offering the
      grossest outrage to justice and common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montagu&rsquo;s other argument, namely, that Bacon, though he took gifts,
      did not take bribes, seems to us as futile as that which we have
      considered. Indeed, <span class="pagenum">428</span><a name="link428"
       id="link428"></a>we might be content to leave it to be answered by the
      plainest man among our readers. Demosthenes noticed it with contempt more
      than two thousand years ago. Latimer, we have seen, treated this sophistry
      with similar disdain. &ldquo;Leave colouring,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and call these things
      by their Christian name, bribes.&rdquo; Mr. Montagu attempts, somewhat unfairly,
      we must say, to represent the presents which Bacon received as similar to
      the perquisites which suitors paid to the members of the Parliaments of
      France. The French magistrate had a legal right to his fee: and the amount
      of the fee was regulated by law. Whether this be a good mode of
      remunerating judges is not the question. But what analogy is there between
      payments of this sort and the presents which Bacon received, presents
      which were not sanctioned by the law, which were not made under the public
      eye, and of which the amount was regulated only by private bargain between
      the magistrate and the suitor?
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, it is mere trifling to say that Bacon could not have meant to act
      corruptly because he employed the agency of men of rank, of bishops, privy
      councillors, and members of Parliament; as if the whole history of that
      generation was not full of the low actions of high people; as if it was
      not notorious that men, as exalted in rank as any of the decoys that Bacon
      employed, had pimped for Somerset and poisoned Overbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, says Mr. Montagu, these presents &ldquo;were made openly and with the
      greatest publicity.&rdquo; This would indeed be a strong argument in favour of
      Bacon. But we deny the fact. In one, and one only, of the cases in which
      Bacon was accused of corruptly receiving gifts, does he appear to have
      received a gift publicly. This was in a matter depending between the
      Company <span class="pagenum">429</span><a name="link429" id="link429"></a>of
      Apothecaries and the Company of Grocers. Bacon, in his Confession,
      insisted strongly on the circumstance that he had on this occasion taken a
      present publicly, as a proof that he had not taken it corruptly. Is it not
      clear that, if he had taken the presents mentioned in the other charges in
      the same public manner, he would have dwelt on this point in his answer to
      those charges? The fact that he insists so strongly on the publicity of
      one particular present is of itself sufficient to prove that the other
      presents were not publicly taken. Why he took this present publicly and
      the rest secretly, is evident. He on that occasion acted openly, because
      he was acting honestly. He was not on that occasion sitting judicially. He
      was called in to effect an amicable arrangement between two parties. Both
      were satisfied with his decision. Both joined in making him a present in
      return for his trouble. Whether it was quite delicate in a man of his rank
      to accept a present under such circumstances, may be questioned. But there
      is no ground in this case for accusing him of corruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily, the very circumstances which prove him to have been innocent in
      this case prove him to have been guilty on the other charges. Once, and
      once only, he alleges that he received a present publicly. The natural
      inference is that in all the other cases mentioned in the articles against
      him he received presents secretly. When we examine the single case in
      which he alleges that he received a present publicly, we find that it is
      also the single case in which there was no gross impropriety in his
      receiving a present. Is it then possible to doubt that his reason for not
      receiving other presents in as public a manner was that he knew that it
      was wrong to receive them?
    </p>
    <p>
      One argument still remains, plausible in appearance. <span class="pagenum">430</span><a
      name="link430" id="link430"></a>but admitting of easy and complete
      refutation. The two chief complainants, Aubrey and Egerton, had both made
      presents to the Chancellor. But he had decided against them both.
      Therefore, he had not received those presents as bribes. &ldquo;The complaints
      of his accusers were,&rdquo; says Mr. Montagu, &ldquo;not that the gratuities had, but
      that they had not influenced Bacon&rsquo;s judgment, as he had decided against
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The truth is, that it is precisely in this way that an extensive system of
      corruption is generally detected. A person who, by a bribe, has procured a
      decree in his favour, is by no means likely to come forward of his own
      accord as an accuser. He is content. He has his quid pro quo. He is not
      impelled either by interested or by vindictive motives to bring the
      transaction before the public. On the contrary, he has almost as strong
      motives for holding his tongue as the judge himself can have.&rsquo; But when a
      judge practises corruption, as we fear that Bacon practised it, on a large
      scale, and has many agents looking out in different quarters for prey, it
      will sometimes happen that he will be bribed on both sides. It will
      sometimes happen that he will receive money from suitors who are so
      obviously in the wrong that he cannot with decency do any thing to serve
      them. Thus lie will now and then be forced to pronounce against a person
      from whom he has received a present; and he makes that person a deadly
      enemy. The hundreds who have got what they paid for remain quiet. It is
      the two or three who have paid, and have nothing to show for their money,
      who are noisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The memorable case of the Goëzmans is an example of this. Beaumarchais had
      an important suit depending before the Parliament of Paris. M. Goëzman was
      the judge on whom chiefly the decision depended. It <span class="pagenum">431</span><a
      name="link431" id="link431"></a>was hinted to Beaumarchais that Madame
      Goëzman might be propitiated by a present. He accordingly offered a purse
      of gold to the lady, who received it graciously. There can be no doubt
      that, if the decision of the court had been favourable to him, these
      things would never have been known to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he lost his cause. Almost the whole sum which he had expended in
      bribery was immediately refunded; and those who had disappointed him
      probably thought that he would not, for the mere gratification of his
      malevolence, make public a transaction which was discreditable to himself
      as well as to them. They knew little of him. He soon taught them to curse
      the day in which they had dared to trifle with a man of so revengeful and
      turbulent a spirit, of such dauntless effrontery, and of such eminent
      talents for controversy and satire. He compelled the Parliament to put a
      degrading stigma on M. Goëzman. He drove Madame Goëzman to a convent. Till
      it was too late, his excited passions did not suffer him to remember that
      he could effect their ruin only by disclosures ruinous to himself. We
      could give other instances. But it is needless. No person well acquainted
      with human nature can fail to perceive that, if the doctrine for which Mr.
      Montagu contends were admitted, society would be deprived of almost the
      only chance which it has of detecting the corrupt practices of judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      We return to our narrative. The sentence of Bacon had scarcely been
      pronounced when it was mitigated. He was indeed sent to the Tower. But
      this was merely a form. In two days he was set at liberty, and soon after
      he retired to Gorhambury. His fine was speedily released by the Crown. He
      was next suffered to present himself at Court; and at length, in 1624, the
      <span class="pagenum">432</span><a name="link432" id="link432"></a>rest of
      his punishment was remitted. He was now at liberty to resume his seat in
      the House of Lords, and he was actually summoned to the next Parliament.
      But age, infirmity, and perhaps shame, prevented him from attending. The
      Government allowed him a pension of twelve hundred pounds a year; and his
      whole annual income is estimated by Mr. Montagu at two thousand five
      hundred pounds, a sum which was probably above the average income of a
      nobleman of that generation, and which was certainly sufficient for
      comfort and even for splendour. Unhappily, Bacon was fond of display, and
      unused to pay minute attention to domestic affairs. He was not easily
      persuaded to give up any part of the magnificence to which he had been
      accustomed in the time of his power and prosperity. No pressure of
      distress could induce him to part with the woods of Gorhambury. &ldquo;I will
      not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;be stripped of my feathers.&rdquo; He travelled with so splendid
      an equipage and so large a retinue that Prince Charles, who once fell in
      with him on the road, exclaimed with surprise, &ldquo;Well; do what we can, this
      man scorns to go out in snuff.&rdquo; This carelessness and ostentation reduced
      Bacon to frequent distress. He was under the necessity of parting with
      York House, and of taking up his residence, during his visits to London,
      at his old chambers in Gray&rsquo;s Inn. He had other vexations, the exact
      nature of which is unknown. It is evident from his will that some part of
      his wife&rsquo;s conduct had greatly disturbed and irritated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, whatever might be his pecuniary difficulties or his conjugal
      discomforts, the powers of his intellect still remained undiminished.
      Those noble studies for which he had found leisure in the midst of
      professional drudgery and of courtly intrigues gave to this last sad stage
      of <span class="pagenum">433</span><a name="link433" id="link433"></a>his
      life a dignity beyond what power or titles could bestow. Impeached,
      convicted, sentenced, driven with ignominy from the presence of his
      Sovereign, shut out from the deliberations of his fellow nobles, loaded
      with debt, branded with dishonour, sinking under the weight of years,
      sorrows, and diseases, Bacon was Bacon still. &ldquo;My conceit of his person,&rdquo;
       says Ben Jonson very finely, &ldquo;was never increased towards him by his place
      or honours; but I have and do reverence him for the greatness that was
      only proper to himself; in that he seemed to me ever, by his work, one of
      the greatest men and most worthy of admiration, that had been in many
      ages. In his adversity I ever prayed that God would give him strength; for
      greatness he could not want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The services which Bacon rendered to letters during the last five years of
      his life, amidst ten thousand distractions and vexations, increase the
      regret with which we think on the many years which he had wasted, to use
      the words of Sir Thomas Bodley, &ldquo;on such study as was not worthy of such a
      student.&rdquo; He commenced a Digest of the Laws of England, a History of
      England under the Princes of the House of Tudor, a body of Natural
      History, a Philosophical Romance. He made extensive and valuable additions
      to his Essays. He published the inestimable Treatise <i>De Augmentis
      Scientiarum</i>. The very trifles with which he amused himself in hours of
      pain and languor bore the mark of his mind. The best collection of jests
      in the world is that which he dictated from memory, without referring to
      any book, on a day on which illness had rendered him incapable of serious
      study.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great apostle of experimental philosophy was <span class="pagenum">434</span><a
      name="link434" id="link434"></a>destined to be its martyr. It had occurred
      to him that snow might be used with advantage for the purpose of
      preventing animal substances from putrefying. On a very cold day, early in
      the spring of the year 1626, he alighted from his coach near Highgate, in
      order to try the experiment. He went into a cottage, bought a fowl, and
      with his own hands stuffed it with snow. While thus engaged he felt a
      sudden chill, and was soon so much indisposed that it was impossible for
      him to return to Gray&rsquo;s Inn. The Earl of Arundel, with whom he was well
      acquainted, had a house at Highgate. To that house Bacon was carried. The
      Earl was absent; but the servants who were in charge of the place showed
      great respect and attention to the illustrious guest. Here, after an
      illness of about a week, he expired early on the morning of Easter-day,
      1626. His mind appears to have retained its strength and liveliness to the
      end. He did not forget the fowl which had caused his death. In the last
      letter that he ever wrote, with fingers which, as he said, could not
      steadily hold a pen, he did not omit to mention that the experiment of the
      snow had succeeded &ldquo;excellently well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our opinion of the moral character of this great man has already been
      sufficiently explained. Had his life been passed in literary retirement,
      he would, in all probability, have deserved to be considered, not only as
      a great philosopher, but as a worthy and good-natured member of society.
      But neither his principles nor his spirit were such as could be trusted,
      when strong temptations were to be resisted, and serious dangers to be
      braved.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his will he expressed with singular brevity, energy, dignity, and
      pathos, a mournful consciousness <span class="pagenum">435</span><a
      name="link435" id="link435"></a>that his actions had not been such as to
      entitle him to the esteem of those under whose observation his life had
      been passed, and, at the same time, a proud confidence that his writings
      had secured for him a high and permanent place among the benefactors of
      mankind. So at least we understand those striking words which have been
      often quoted, but which we must quote once more; &ldquo;For my name and memory,
      I leave it to men&rsquo;s charitable speeches, and to foreign nations, and to
      the next age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His confidence was just. From the day of his death his fame has been
      constantly and steadily progressive; and we have no doubt that his name
      will be named with reverence to the latest ages, and to the remotest ends
      of the civilised world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief peculiarity of Bacon&rsquo;s philosophy seems to us to have been this,
      that it aimed at things altogether different from those which his
      predecessors had proposed to themselves. This was his own opinion. &ldquo;Finis
      scientiarum,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;a nemine adhuc bene positus est.&rdquo; (1) And again,
      &ldquo;Omnium gravissimus error in deviatione ab ultimo doctrinarum fine
      con-sistit.&rdquo; (2) &ldquo;Nec ipsa meta,&rdquo; says he elsewhere, &ldquo;adhuc ulli, quod
      sciam, mortalium posita est et defixa.&rdquo; (3) The more carefully his works
      are examined, the more clearly, we think, it will appear that this is the
      real clue to his whole system, and that he used means different from those
      used by other philosophers, because he wished to arrive at an end
      altogether different from theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      What then was the end which Bacon proposed to himself? It was, to use his
      own emphatic expression,

       It was the multiplying of human enjoyments and the mitigating of human
      sufferings. It was &ldquo;the relief of man&rsquo;s estate.&rdquo; (1) It was &ldquo;commodis
      humanis inservire.&rdquo; (2) It was &ldquo;efficaciter operari ad sublevanda vitæ
      humanæ incommoda.&rdquo; (3) It was &ldquo;dotare vitam immanam novis inventis et
      copiis.&rdquo; (4) It was &ldquo;genus humanum novis operibus et potestatibus continno
      dotare.&rdquo; (5) This was the object of all his speculations in every
      department of science, in natural philosophy, in legislation, in politics,
      in morals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two words form the key of the Baconian doctrine, Utility and Progress. The
      ancient philosophy disdained to be useful, and was content to be
      stationary. It dealt largely in theories of moral perfection, which were
      so sublime that they never could be more than theories; in attempts to
      solve insoluble enigmas; in exhortations to the attainment of unattainable
      frames of mind. It could not condescend to the humble office of
      ministering to the comfort of human beings. All the schools contemned that
      office as degrading; some censured it as immoral. Once indeed Posidonius,
      a distinguished writer of the age of Cicero and Cæsar, so far forgot
      himself as to enumerate, among the hum-bier blessings which mankind owed
      to philosophy, the discovery of the principle of the arch, and the
      introduction of the use of metals. This eulogy was considered as an
      affront, and was taken up with proper spirit. Seneca vehemently disclaims
      these insulting compliments.6 Philosophy, according to him, has nothing to
      do with teaching men to rear arched roofs over their heads. The true
      philosopher does not care

      <span class="pagenum">437</span><a name="link437" id="link437"></a>whether
      he has an arched roof or any roof. Philosophy has nothing to do with
      teaching men the uses of metals. She teaches us to be independent of all
      material substances, of all mechanical contrivances. The wise man lives
      according; to nature. Instead of attempting to add to the physical
      comforts of his species, he regrets that his lot was not cast in that
      golden age when the human race had no protection against the cold but the
      skins of wild beasts, no screen from the sun but a cavern. To impute to
      such a man any share in the invention or improvement of a plough, a ship,
      or a mill, is an insult. &ldquo;In my own time,&rdquo; says Seneca, &ldquo;there have been
      inventions of this sort, transparent windows, tubes for diffusing warmth
      equally through all parts of a building, short-hand, which has been
      carried to such a perfection that a writer can keep pace with the most
      rapid speaker. But the inventing of such things is drudgery for the lowest
      slaves; philosophy lies deeper. It is not her office to teach men how to
      use their hands. The object of her lessons is to form the soul. Non est,
      inqueim, instrumentorum ad usas necessaries opfex.&rdquo; If the non were left
      out, this last sentence would be no bad description of the Baconian
      philosophy, and would, indeed, very much resemble several expressions in
      the <i>Novum Organum</i>. &ldquo;We shall next be told,&rdquo; exclaims Seneca, &ldquo;that
      the first shoemaker was a philosopher.&rdquo; For our own part, if we are forced
      to make our choice between the first shoemaker, and the author of the
      three books On Anger, we pronounce for the shoemaker. It may be worse to
      be angry than to be wet. But shoes have kept millions from being wet; and
      we doubt whether Seneca ever kept any body from being angry. <span
      class="pagenum">438</span><a name="link438" id="link438"></a>It is very
      reluctantly that Seneca can be brought to confess that any philosopher had
      ever paid the smallest attention to any thing that could possibly promote
      what vulgar people would consider as the well-being of mankind. He labors
      to clear Democritus from the disgraceful imputation of having made the
      first arch, and Anacharsis from the charge of having contrived the
      potter&rsquo;s wheel. He is forced to own that such a thing might happen; and it
      may also happen, he tells us, that a philosopher may be swift of foot. But
      it is not in his character of philosopher that he either wins a race or
      invents a machine. Iso, to be sure. The business of a philosopher was to
      declaim in praise of poverty, with two millions sterling out at usury, to
      meditate epigrammatic conceits about the evils of luxury, in gardens which
      moved the envy of sovereigns, to rant about liberty, while fawning on the
      insolent and pampered freedmen of a tyrant, to celebrate the divine beauty
      of virtue with the same pen which had just before written a defence of the
      murder of a mother by a son.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the cant of this philosophy, a philosophy meanly proud of its own
      unprofitableness, it is delightful to turn to the lessons of the great
      English teacher. We can almost forgive all the faults of Bacon&rsquo;s life when
      we read that singularly graceful and dignified passage: &ldquo;Ego certe, ut de
      me ipso, quod res est, loquar, et in iis que nunc edo, et in iis quæ in
      posterum meditor, dignitatem ingenii et nominis mei, si qua sit, sæpius
      sciens et volens projicio, dum commodis humanis inserviam; quique
      arehitectus fortasse in phi-losophia et scientiis esse debeam, etiam
      operarius, et bajulus, et quidvis demum fio, cum baud pauca pue omnino
      fieri necesse sit, alii an tern ob innatam superbiam <span class="pagenum">439</span><a
      name="link439" id="link439"></a> <span class="pagenum">439</span><a
      name="link439" id="link439_"></a>subterfugiant, ipse sustineam et
      exsequar.&rdquo; (1) This <i>philanthropia</i>, which, as he said in one of the
      most remarkable of his early letters, &ldquo;was so fixed in his mind, as it
      could not be removed,&rdquo; this majestic humility, this persuasion that
      nothing can be too insignificant for the attention of the wisest, which is
      not too insignificant to give pleasure or pain to the meanest, is the
      great characteristic distinction, the essential spirit of the Baconian
      philosophy. We trace it in all that Bacon has written on Physics, on Laws,
      on Morals. And we conceive that from this peculiarity all the other
      peculiarities of his system directly and almost necessarily sprang.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit which appears in the passage of Seneca to which we have
      referred, tainted the whole body of the ancient philosophy from the time
      of Socrates downwards, and took possession of intellects with which that
      of Seneca cannot for a moment be compared. It pervades the dialogues of
      Plato. It may be distinctly traced in many parts of the works of
      Aristotle. Bacon has dropped hints, from which it may be inferred that, in
      his opinion, the prevalence of this feeling was in a great measure to be
      attributed to the influence of Socrates. Our great countryman evidently
      did not consider the revolution which Socrates effected in philosophy as a
      happy event, and constantly maintained that the earlier Greek speculators,
      Democritus in particular, were, on the whole, superior to their more
      celebrated successors. (2)

      watered is to be judged of by its flowers and leaves, it is the noblest of
      trees. But if we take the homely test of Bacon, if we judge of the tree by
      its fruits, our opinion of it may perhaps be less favourable. When we sum
      up all the useful truths which we owe to that philosophy, to what do they
      amount? We find, indeed, abundant proofs that some of those who cultivated
      it were men of the first order of intellect. We find among their writings
      incomparable specimens both of dialectical and rhetorical art. We have no
      doubt that the ancient controversies were of use, in so far as they served
      to exercise the faculties of the disputants; for there is no controversy
      so idle that it may not be of use in this way. But, when we look for
      something more, for something which adds to the comforts or alleviates the
      calamities of the human race, we are forced to own ourselves disappointed.
      We are forced to say with Bacon that this celebrated philosophy ended in
      nothing but disputation, that it was neither a vineyard nor an
      olive-ground, but an intricate wood of briars and thistles, from which
      those who lost themselves in it brought back many scratches and no food.

      We readily acknowledge that some of the teachers of this unfruitful wisdom
      were among the greatest men that the world has ever seen. If we admit the
      justice of Bacon&rsquo;s censure, we admit it with regret, similar to that which
      Dante felt when he learned the fate of those illustrious heathens who were

      eminent philosophers of antiquity forces us to adopt the opinion that
      their powers were systematically misdirected. For how else could it be
      that such powers should effect so little for mankind? A pedestrian may
      show as much muscular vigour on a treadmill as on the highway road. But on
      the road his vigour will assuredly carry him forward; and on the treadmill
      he will not advance an inch. The ancient philosophy was a treadmill, not a
      path. It was made up of revolving questions, of controversies which were
      always beginning again. It was a contrivance for having much exertion and
      no progress. We must acknowledge that more than once, while contemplating
      the doctrines of the Academy and the Portico, even as they appear in the
      transparent splendour of Cicero&rsquo;s incomparable diction, we have been
      tempted to mutter with the surly centurion in Persius, &ldquo;Cur quis non
      prandeat hoc est?&rdquo; What is the highest good, whether pain be an evil,
      whether all things be fated, whether we can be certain of any thing,
      whether we can be certain that we are certain of nothing, whether a wise
      man can be unhappy, whether all departures from right be equally
      reprehensible, these, and other questions of the same sort, occupied the
      brains, the tongues, and the pens of the ablest men in the civilised world
      during several centuries. This sort of philosophy, it is evident, could
      not be progressive. It might indeed sharpen and invigorate the minds of
      those who devoted themselves to it; and so might the disputes of the
      orthodox Lilliputians and the heretical Blefuscudians about the big ends
      and the little ends of eggs. But such disputes could add nothing to the
      stock of knowledge. The human mind accordingly, instead of marching,
      merely marked time. It took as much trouble as would have sufficed to
      carry it forward; <span class="pagenum">442</span><a name="link442"
       id="link442"></a>and yet remained on the same spot. There was no
      accumulation of truth, no heritage of truth acquired by the labour of one
      generation and bequeathed to another, to be again transmitted with large
      additions to a third. Where this philosophy was in the time of Cicero,
      there it continued to be in the time of Seneca, and there it continued to
      be in the time of Favorinus. The same sects were still battling with the
      same unsatisfactory arguments about the same interminable questions. There
      had been no want of ingenuity, of zeal, of industry. Every trace of
      intellectual cultivation was there, except a harvest. There had been
      plenty of ploughing, harrowing, reaping, threshing. But the garners
      contained only smut and stubble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient philosophers did not neglect natural science; but they did not
      cultivate it for the purpose of increasing the power and ameliorating the
      condition of man. The taint of barrenness had spread from ethical to
      physical speculations. Seneca wrote largely on natural philosophy, and
      magnified the importance of that study. But why? Not because it tended to
      assuage suffering, to multiply the conveniences of life, to extend the
      empire of man over the material world; but solely because it tended to
      raise the mind above low cares, to separate it from the body, to exercise
      its subtilty in the solution of very obscure questions. (1) Thus natural
      philosophy was considered in the light merely of a mental exercise. It was
      made subsidiary to the art of disputation; and it consequently proved
      altogether barren of useful discoveries.

      should seem, to have merited an exception from the general censure which
      Bacon has pronounced on the ancient schools of wisdom. The Epicurean, who
      referred all happiness to bodily pleasure, and all evil to bodily pain,
      might have been expected to exert himself for the purpose of bettering his
      own physical condition and that of his neighbours. But the thought seems
      never to have occurred to any member of that school. Indeed, their notion,
      as reported by their great poet, was, that no more improvements were to be
      expected in the arts which conduce to the comfort of life. <br /><br /><span

    <p>
      This contented despondency, this disposition to admire what has been done,
      and to expect that nothing more will be done, is strongly characteristic
      of all the schools which preceded the school of Fruit and Progress. Widely
      as the Epicurean and the Stoic differed on most points, they seem to have
      quite agreed in their contempt for pursuits so vulgar as to be useful. The
      philosophy of both was a garrulous, declaiming, canting, wrangling
      philosophy. Century after century they continued to repeat their hostile
      war-cries, Virtue and Pleasure; and in the end it appeared that the
      Epicurean had added as little to the quantity of pleasure as the Stoic to
      the quantity of virtue. It is on the pedestal of Bacon, not on that of
      Epicurus, that those noble lines ought to be inscribed: <br /><br /><span

      In the fifth century Christianity had conquered Paganism, and Paganism had
      infected Christianity. The Church was now victorious and corrupt. The
      <span class="pagenum">444</span><a name="link444" id="link444"></a>rites
      of the Pantheon had passed into her worship, the subtilties of the Academy
      into her creed. In an evil day, though with great pomp and solemnity,&mdash;we
      quote the language of Bacon,&mdash;was the ill-starred alliance stricken
      between the old philosophy and the new faith. (1) Questions widely
      different from those which had employed the ingenuity of Pyrrho and
      Carneades, but just as subtle, just as interminable, and just as
      unprofitable, exercised the minds of the lively and voluble Greeks. When
      learning began to revive in the West, similar trifles occupied the sharp
      and vigorous intellects of the Schoolmen. There was another sowing of the
      wind, and another reaping of the whirlwind. The great work of improving
      the condition of the human race was still considered as unworthy of a man
      of learning. Those who undertook that task, if what they effected could be
      readily comprehended, were despised as mechanics; if not, they were in
      danger of being burned as conjurers.

    <p>
      There cannot be a stronger proof of the degree in which the human mind had
      been misdirected than the history of the two greatest events which took
      place du ring the middle ages. We speak of the invention of Gunpowder and
      of the invention of Printing. The dates of both are unknown. The authors
      of both are unknown. Nor was this because men were too rude and ignorant
      to value intellectual superiority. The inventor of gunpowder appears to
      have been contemporary with Petrarch and Boccaccio. The inventor of
      printing was certainly contemporary with Nicholas the Fifth, with Cosmo
      de&rsquo; Medici, and with a crowd of distinguished scholars. But the human mind
      still retained that fatal bent which it had received two

      years earlier. George of Trebisond and Marsilio Ficino would not easily
      have been brought to believe that the inventor of the printing-press had
      done more for mankind than themselves, or than those ancient writers of
      whom they were the enthusiastic votaries.

    <p>
      At length the time arrived when the barren philosophy which had, during so
      many ages, employed the faculties of the ablest of men, was destined to
      fall. It had worn many shapes. It had mingled itself with many creeds. It
      had survived revolutions in which empires, religions, languages, races,
      had perished. Driven from its ancient haunts, it had taken sanctuary in
      that Church which it had persecuted, and had, like the daring friends of
      the poet, placed its seat <br /><br /><span class="indent30">"next the seat
      of God, <br /><span class="indent20">And with its darkness dared affront

      Words, and more words, and nothing but words, had been all the fruit of
      all the toil of all the most renowned sages of sixty generations. But the
      days of this sterile exuberance were numbered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many causes predisposed the public mind to a change. The study of a great
      variety of ancient writers, though it did not give a right direction to
      philosophical research, did much towards destroying that blind reverence
      for authority which had prevailed when Aristotle ruled alone. The rise of
      the Florentine sect of Platonists, a sect to which belonged some of the
      finest minds of the fifteenth century, was not an unimportant event. The
      mere substitution of the Academic for the Peripatetic philosophy would
      indeed have done little good. But any thing was better than the old habit
      of unreasoning servility. It was <span class="pagenum">446</span><a
      name="link446" id="link446"></a>something to have a choice of tyrants. &ldquo;A
      spark of freedom,&rdquo; as Gibbon has justly remarked, &ldquo;was produced by this
      collision of adverse servitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Other causes might be mentioned. But it is chiefly to the great
      reformation of religion that we owe the great reformation of philosophy.
      The alliance between the Schools and the Vatican had for ages been so
      close that those who threw off the dominion of the Vatican could not
      continue to recognise the authority of the Schools. Most of the chiefs of
      the schism treated the Peripatetic philosophy with contempt, and spoke of
      Aristotle as if Aristotle had been answerable for all the dogmas of Thomas
      Aquinas. &ldquo;Nullo apud Lutheranos philosophiam esse in pretio,&rdquo; was a
      reproach which the defenders of the Church of Rome loudly repeated, and
      which many of the Protestant leaders considered as a compliment. Scarcely
      any text was more frequently cited by the reformers than that in which St.
      Paul cautions the Colossians not to let any man spoil them by philosophy.
      Luther, almost at the outset of his career, went so far as to declare that
      no man could be at once a proficient in the school of Aristotle and in
      that of Christ. Zwingle, Bucer, Peter Martyr, Calvin, held similar
      language. In some of the Scotch universities, the Aristotelian system was
      discarded for that of Ramus. Thus, before the birth of Bacon, the empire
      cf the scholastic philosophy had been shaken to its foundations. There was
      in the intellectual world an anarchy resembling that which in the
      political world often follows the overthrow of an old and deeply rooted
      government. Antiquity, prescription, the sound of great names, had ceased
      to awe mankind. The dynasty which had reigned for ages was at an end; and
      the vacant throne was left to be struggled for by pretenders. <span
      class="pagenum">447</span><a name="link447" id="link447"></a>The first
      effect of this great revolution, was, as Bacon most justly observed, (1)
      to give for a time an undue importance to the mere graces of style. The
      new breed of scholars, the Aschams and Buchanans, nourished with the
      finest compositions of the Augustan age, regarded with loathing the dry,
      crabbed, and barbarous diction of respondents and opponents, They were far
      less studious about the matter of their writing than about the manner.
      They succeeded in reforming Latinity; but they never even aspired to
      effect a reform in philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time Bacon appeared. It is altogether incorrect to say, as has
      often been said, that he was the first man who rose up against the
      Aristotelian philosophy when in the height of its power. The authority of
      that philosophy had, as we have shown, received a fatal blow long before
      he was born. Several speculators, among whom Ramus is the best known, had
      recently attempted to form new sects. Bacon&rsquo;s own expressions about the
      state of public opinion in the time of Luther are clear and strong:
      &ldquo;Accedebat,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;odium et contemptus, illis ipsis temporibus ortus
      erga Scholasticos.&rdquo; And again, &ldquo;Scholasticorum doctrina despectui prorsus
      haberi copit tanquam aspera et barbara.&rdquo; (2) The part which Bacon played
      in this great change was the part, not of Robespierre, but of Bonaparte.
      The ancient order of things had been subverted. Some bigots still
      cherished with devoted loyalty the remembrance of the fallen monarchy and
      exerted themselves to effect a restoration. But the majority had no such
      feeling. Freed, yet not knowing how to use their freedom,

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">448</span><a name="link448" id="link448"></a>they
      pursued no determinate course, and had found no leader capable of
      conducting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      That leader at length arose. The philosophy which he taught was
      essentially new. It differed from that of the celebrated ancient teachers,
      not merely in method, but also in object. Its object was the good of
      mankind, in the sense in which the mass of mankind always have understood
      and always will understand the word good. &ldquo;Meditor,&rdquo; said Bacon,
      &ldquo;instaurationem philosophise ejusmodi quæ nihil inanis ant abstracti
      habeat, quæque vitæ liumanæ conditiones in melius provehat.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between the philosophy of Bacon and that of his
      predecessors cannot, we think, be better illustrated than by comparing his
      views on some important subjects with those of Plato. We select Plato,
      because we conceive that he did more than any other person towards giving
      to the minds of speculative men that bent which they retained till they
      received from Bacon a new impulse in a diametrically opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is curious to observe how differently these great men estimated the
      value of every kind of knowledge. Take Arithmetic for example. Plato,
      after speaking slightly of the convenience of being able to reckon and
      compute in the ordinary transactions of life, passes to what he considers
      as a far more important advantage. The study of the properties of numbers,
      he tells us, habituates the mind to the contemplation of pure truth, and
      raises us above the material universe. He would have his disciples apply
      themselves to this study, not that they may be able to buy or sell, not
      that they may qualify themselves to be shop-keepers

      travelling merchants, but that they may learn to withdraw their minds from
      the ever-shifting spectacle of this visible and tangible world, and to fix
      them on the immutable essences of things. (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon, on the other hand, valued this branch of knowledge, only on account
      of its uses with reference to that visible and tangible world which Plato
      so much despised. He speaks with scorn of the mystical arithmetic of the
      later Platonists, and laments the propensity of mankind to employ, on mere
      matters of curiosity, powers the whole exertion of which is required for
      purposes of solid advantage. He advises arithmeticians to leave these
      trifles, and to employ themselves in framing convenient expressions, which
      may be of use in physical researches. (2)
    </p>
    <p>
      The same reasons which led Plato to recommend the study of arithmetic led
      him to recommend also the study of mathematics. The vulgar crowd of
      geometricians, he says, will not understand him. They have practice always
      in view. They do not know that the real use of the science is to lead men
      to the knowledge of abstract, essential, eternal truth. (3) Indeed, if we
      are to believe Plutarch, Plato carried this feeling so far that he
      considered geometry as degraded by being applied to any purpose of vulgar
      utility. Archytas, it seems, had framed machines of extraordinary power on
      mathematical principles. (4) Plato remonstrated with his friend, and
      declared that this was to degrade a noble intellectual exercise into a low
      craft, fit only for carpenters and wheelwrights. The office of geometry,

      was to discipline the mind, not to minister to the base wants of the body.
      His interference was successful; and from that time, according to
      Plutarch, the science of mechanics was considered as unworthy of the
      attention of a philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archimedes in a later age imitated and surpassed Archytas. But even
      Archimedes was not free from the prevailing notion that geometry was
      degraded by being employed to produce any thing useful. It was with
      difficulty that he was induced to stoop from speculation to practice. He
      was half ashamed of those inventions which were the wonder of hostile
      nations, and always spoke of them slightingly as mere amusements, as
      trifles in which a mathematician might be suffered to relax his mind after
      intense application to the higher parts of his science.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opinion of Bacon on this subject was diametrically opposed to that of
      the ancient philosophers. He valued geometry chiefly, if not solely, on
      account of those uses, which to Plato appeared so base. And it is
      remarkable that the longer Bacon lived the stronger this feeling became.
      When in 1605 he wrote the two books on the Advancement of Learning, he
      dwelt on the advantages which mankind derived from mixed mathematics; but
      he at the same time admitted that the beneficial effect produced by
      mathematical study on the intellect, though a collateral advantage, was
      &ldquo;no less worthy than that which was principal and intended.&rdquo; But it is
      evident that his views underwent a change. When, near twenty years later,
      he published the <i>De Augmentis</i>, which is the Treatise on the
      Advancement of Learning, greatly expanded and carefully corrected, he made
      important alterations in the part which related to mathematics. <span
      class="pagenum">451</span><a name="link451" id="link451"></a>He condemned
      with severity the high pretensions of the mathematicians, &ldquo;delicias et
      fastum mathemati-corum.&rdquo; Assuming the well-being of the human race to be
      the end of knowledge, (1) he pronounced that mathematical science could
      claim no higher rank than that of an appendage or an auxiliary to other
      sciences. Mathematical science, he says, is the handmaid of natural
      philosophy; she ought to demean herself as such; and he declares that he
      cannot conceive by what ill chance it has happened that she presumes to
      claim precedence over her mistress. He predicts&mdash;a prediction which
      would have made Plato shudder&mdash;that as more and more discoveries are
      made in physics, there will be more and more branches of mixed
      mathematics. Of that collateral advantage the value of which, twenty years
      before, he rated so highly, he says not one word. This omission cannot
      have been the effect of mere inadvertence. His own treatise was before
      him. From that treatise he deliberately expunged whatever was favourable
      to the study of pure mathematics, and inserted several keen reflections on
      the ardent votaries of that study. This fact, in our opinion, admits of
      only one explanation. Bacon&rsquo;s love of those pursuits which directly tend
      to improve the condition of mankind, and his jealousy of all pursuits
      merely curious, had grown upon him, and had, it may be, become immoderate.
      He was afraid of using any expression which might have the effect of
      inducing any man of talents to employ in speculations, useful only to the
      mind of the speculator, a single hour which might be employed in extending
      the empire of man over matter. (2) If Bacon erred here, we

      acknowledge that we greatly prefer his error to the opposite error of
      Plato. We have no patience with a philosophy which, like those Roman
      matrons who swallowed abortives in order to preserve their shapes, takes
      pains to be barren for fear of being homely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us pass to astronomy. This was one of the sciences which Plato
      exhorted his disciples to learn, but for reasons for removed from common
      habits of thinking. &ldquo;Shall we set down astronomy,&rdquo; says Socrates, &ldquo;among
      the subjects of study?&rdquo; (1) &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; answers his young friend
      Glaucon: &ldquo;to know something about the seasons, the months, and the years
      is of use for military purposes, as well as for agriculture and
      navigation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It amuses me,&rdquo; says Socrates, &ldquo;to see how afraid you are, lest the common
      herd of people should accuse you of recommending useless studies.&rdquo; He then
      proceeds, in that pure and magnificent diction which, as Cicero said,
      Jupiter would use if Jupiter spoke Greek, to explain that the use of
      astronomy is not to add to the vulgar comforts of life, but to assist in
      raising the mind to the contemplation of things which are to be perceived
      by the pure intellect alone. The knowledge of the actual motions of the
      heavenly bodies Socrates considers as of little value. The appearances
      which make the sky beautiful at night are, he tells us, like the figures
      which a geometrician draws on the sand, mere examples, mere helps to
      feeble minds. We must get beyond them; we must neglect them; we must
      attain to an astronomy which is as independent of the actual stars as

      to the ox of Prometheus, (1) a sleek, wellshaped hide, stuffed with
      rubbish, goodly to look at, but containing nothing to eat. He complained
      that astronomy had, to its great injury, been separated from natural
      philosophy, of which it was one of the noblest provinces, and annexed to
      the domain of mathematics. The world stood in need, he said, of a very
      different astronomy, of a living astronomy, (2) of an astronomy which
      should set forth the nature, the motion, and the influences of the
      heavenly bodies, as they really are. (3)

      On the greatest and most useful of all human inventions, the invention of
      alphabetical writing, Plato did not look with much complacency. He seems
      to have thought that the use of letters had operated on the human mind as
      the use of the go-cart in learning to walk, or of corks in learning to
      swim, is said to operate on the human body. It was a support which, in his
      opinion, soon became indispensable to those who used it, which made
      vigorous exertion first unnecessary and then impossible. The powers of the
      intellect would, he conceived, have been more fully developed without this
      delusive aid. Men would have been compelled to exercise? the understanding
      and the memory, and, by deep and assiduous meditation, to make truth
      thoroughly their own. Now, on the contrary, much knowledge is traced on
      paper, but little is engraved in the soul. A man is certain that he can
      find information at a moment&rsquo;s notice when he wants it. He therefore
      suffers it to fade from his mind. Such a man cannot in strictness

      Bacon&rsquo;s views, as may easily be supposed, were widely different. (3) The
      powers of the memory, he observes, without the help of writing, can do
      little towards the advancement of any useful science. He acknowledges that
      the memory may be disciplined to such a point as to be able to perform
      very extraordinary feats. But on such feats he sets little value. The
      habits of his mind, he tells us, are such that he is not disposed to rate
      highly any accomplishment, however rare, which is of no practical use to
      mankind. As to these prodigious achievements of the memory, he ranks them
      with the exhibitions of rope-dancers and tumblers. &ldquo;The two performances,&rdquo;
       he says, &ldquo;are of much the same sort. The one is an abuse of the powers of
      the body; the other is an abuse of the powers of the mind. Both may
      perhaps excite our wonder; but neither is entitled to our respect."(4)

      of a chronic disease, which repairs frames enervated by lust, swollen by

      the intellect has ceased to retain its entire energy, had no share of his
      esteem. A life protracted by medical skill he pronounced to be a long
      death. The existence of the art of medicine ought, he said, to be
      tolerated, so far as that art may serve to cure the occasional distempers
      of men whose constitutions are good. As to those who have bad
      constitutions, let them die; and the sooner the better. Such men are unfit
      for war, for magistracy, for the management of their domestic affairs, for
      severe study and speculation. If they engage in any vigorous mental
      exercise, they are troubled with giddiness and fulness of the head, all
      which they lay to the account of philosophy. The best thing that can
      happen to such wretches is to have done with life at once. He quotes
      mythical authority in support of this doctrine; and reminds his disciples
      that the practice of the sons of Æsculapius, as described by Homer,
      extended only to the cure of external injuries.

      Far different was the philosophy of Bacon. Of all the sciences, that which
      he seems to have regarded with the greatest interest was the science
      which, in Plato&rsquo;s opinion, would not be tolerated in a well regulated
      community. To make men perfect was no part of Bacon&rsquo;s plan. His humble aim
      was to make imperfect men comfortable. The beneficence of his philosophy
      resembled the beneficence of the common Father, whose sun rises on the
      evil and the good, whose rain descends for the just and the unjust. In
      Plato&rsquo;s opinion man was made for philosophy; in Bacon&rsquo;s opinion philosophy
      was made for man; it was a means to an end; and that end was to increase
      the pleasures and to mitigate the pains of millions who are not and cannot
      be philosophers. That a valetudinarian who took great pleasure in being
      wheeled along his terrace, who relished <span class="pagenum">456</span><a
      name="link456" id="link456"></a>his boiled chicken and his weak wine and
      water, and who enjoyed a hearty laugh over the Queen of Navarre&rsquo;s tales,
      should be treated as a <i>caput lupinum</i> because he could not read the
      Timæus without a headache, was a notion which the humane spirit of the
      English school of wisdom altogether rejected. Bacon would not have thought
      it beneath the dignity of a philosopher to contrive an improved garden
      chair for such a valetudinarian, to devise some way of rendering his
      medicines more palatable, to invent repasts which he might enjoy, and
      pillows on which he might sleep soundly; and this though there might not
      be the smallest hope that the mind of the poor invalid would ever rise to
      the contemplation of the ideal beautiful and the ideal good. As Plato had
      cited the religious legends of Greece to justify his contempt for the more
      recondite parts of the art of healing, Bacon vindicated the dignity of
      that art by appealing to the example of Christ, and reminded men that the
      great Physician of the soul did not disdain to be also the physician of
      the body. (1)

    <p>
      When we pass from the science of medicine to that of legislation, we find
      the same difference between the systems of these two great men. Plato, at
      the commencement of the Dialogue on Laws, lays it down as a fundamental
      principle that the end of legislation is to make men virtuous. It is
      unnecessary to point out the extravagant conclusions to which such a
      proposition leads. Bacon well knew to how great an extent the happiness of
      every society must depend on the virtue of its members; and he also knew
      what legislators can and what they cannot do for the purpose of promoting
      virtue. The view which he has given of the end of
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) De Augmentis, Lib. 4. Cap. 2.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">457</span><a name="link457" id="link457"></a>legislation,
      and of the principal means for the attainment of that end, has always
      seemed to us eminently happy, even among the many happy passages of the
      same kind with which his works abound. &ldquo;Finis et scopus quem leges intueri
      atopie ad quern jussion es et sanction es suas dirigere debent, non alius
      est quam ut cives féliciter degant. Id fixet si pietate et religione recte
      instituti, moribus honesti, armis ad versus liostes externos tuti, legum
      auxilio adversus seditiones et pri-vatas injurias muniti, imperio et
      magistratibus obse-quentes, copiis et opibus locupletes et florentes
      fluent.&rdquo; (1) The end is the well-being of the people. The means are the
      imparting of moral and religious education; the providing of every thing
      necessary for defence against foreign enemies; the maintaining of internal
      order; the establishing of a judicial, financial, and commercial system,
      under which wealth may be rapidly accumulated and securely enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even with respect to the form in which laws ought to be drawn, there is a
      remarkable difference of opinion between the Greek and the Englishman.
      Plato thought a preamble essential; Bacon thought it mischievous. Each was
      consistent with himself. Plato, considering the moral improvement of the
      people as the end of legislation, justly inferred that a law which
      commanded and threatened, but which neither convinced the reason, nor
      touched the heart, must be a most imperfect law. He was not content with
      deterring from theft a man who still continued to be a thief at heart,
      with restraining a son who hated his mother from beating his mother. The
      only obedience on which he set much value was the obedience which an
      enlightened

      yields to reason, and which a virtuous disposition yields to precepts of
      virtue. He really seems to have believed that, by prefixing to every law
      an eloquent and pathetic exhortation, he should, to a great extent, render
      penal enactments superfluous. Bacon entertained no such romantic hopes;
      and he well knew the practical inconveniences of the course which Plato
      recommended. &ldquo;Neque nobis,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;prologi legum qui inepti olim
      liabiti sunt, et leges in-troducunt disputantes non jubentes, utique
      placèrent, si priscos mores ferre possemus....Quantum fieri potest prologi

      Each of the great men whom we have compared intended to illustrate his
      system by a philosophical romance; and each left his romance imperfect.
      Had Plato lived to finish the Critias, a comparison between that noble
      fiction and the new Atlantis would probably have furnished us with still
      more striking instances than any which we have given. It is amusing to
      think with what horror he would have seen such an institution as Solomon&rsquo;s
      House rising in his republic: with what vehemence he would have ordered
      the brewhouses, the perfume-houses, and the dispensatories to be pulled
      down; and with what inexorable rigour he would have driven beyond the
      frontier all the Fellows of the College, Merchants of Light and
      Depredators, Lamps and Pioneers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To sum up the whole, we should say that the aim of the Platonic philosophy
      was to exalt man into a god. The aim of the Baconian philosophy was to
      provide man with what he requires while he continues to be man. The aim of
      the Platonic philosophy was to raise

      Plato drew a good bow; but, like Acestes in Virgil, he aimed at the stars;
      and therefore, though there was no want of strength or skill, the shot was
      thrown away. His arrow was indeed followed by a track of dazzling
      radiance, but it struck nothing. <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"Volans

      Bacon fixed his eye on a mark which was placed on the earth, and within
      bow-shot, and hit it in the white. The philosophy of Plato began in words
      and ended in words, noble words indeed, words such as were to be expected
      from the finest of human intellects exercising boundless dominion over the
      finest of human languages. The philosophy of Bacon began in observations
      and ended in arts.

    <p>
      The boast of the ancient philosophers was that their doctrine formed the
      minds of men to a high degree of wisdom and virtue. This was indeed the
      only practical good which the most celebrated of those teachers even
      pretended to effect; and undoubtedly, if they had effected this, they
      would have deserved far higher praise than if they had discovered the most
      salutary medicines or constructed the most powerful machines. But the
      truth is that, in those very matters in which alone they professed to do
      any good to mankind, in those very matters for the sake of which they
      neglected all the vulgar interests of mankind, they did nothing, or worse
      than nothing. They promised what was impracticable; they despised what was
      practicable; they <span class="pagenum">460</span><a name="link460"
       id="link460"></a>filled the world with long words and long beards; and
      they left it as wicked and as ignorant as they found it.
    </p>
    <p>
      An acre in Middlesex is better than a principality in Utopia. The smallest
      actual good is better than the most magnificent promises of
      impossibilities. The wise man of the Stoics would, no doubt, be a grander
      object than a steam-engine. But there are steam-engines. And the wise man
      of the Stoics is yet to be born. A philosophy which should enable a man to
      feel perfectly happy while in agonies of pain would be better than a
      philosophy which assuages pain. But we know that there are remedies which
      will assuage pain and we know that the ancient sages liked the toothache
      just as little as their neighbours. A philosophy which should extinguish
      cupidity would be better than a philosophy which should devise laws for
      the security of property. But it is possible to make laws which shall, to
      a very great extent, secure property. And we do not understand how any
      motives which the ancient philosophy furnished could extinguish cupidity.
      Mre know indeed that the philosophers were no better than other men. From
      the testimony of friends as well as of foes, from the confessions of
      Epictetus and Seneca, as well as from the sneers of Lucian and the fierce
      invectives of Juvenal, it is plain that these teachers of virtue had all
      the vices of their neighbours, with the additional vice of hypocrisy. Some
      people may think the object of the Baconian philosophy a low object, but
      they cannot deny that, high or low, it has been attained. They cannot deny
      that every year makes an addition to what Bacon called &ldquo;fruit.&rdquo; They
      cannot deny that mankind have made, and are making, great and constant
      progress in the road which he pointed out to them. Was <span
      class="pagenum">461</span><a name="link461" id="link461"></a>there any
      such progressive movement among the ancient philosophers? After they had
      been declaiming eight hundred years, had they made the world better than
      when they began? Our belief is that, among the philosophers themselves,
      instead of a progressive improvement there was a progressive degeneracy.
      An abject superstition which Democritus or Anaxagoras would have rejected
      with scorn added the last disgrace to the long dotage of the Stoic and
      Platonic schools. Those unsuccessful attempts to articulate which are so
      delightful and interesting in a child shock and disgust us in an aged
      paralytic; and in the same way, those wild mythological fictions which
      charm us, when we hear them lisped by Greek poetry in its infancy, excite
      a mixed sensation of pity and loathing, when mumbled by Greek philosophy
      in its old age. We know that guns, cutlery, spy-glasses, clocks, are
      better in our time than they were in the time of our fathers, and were
      better in the time of our fathers than they were in the time of our
      grandfathers. We might, therefore, be inclined to think that, when a
      philosophy which boasted that its object was the elevation and
      purification of the mind, and which for this object neglected the sordid
      office of ministering to the comforts of the body, had flourished in the
      highest honour during many hundreds of years, a vast moral amelioration
      must have taken place. Was it so? Look at the schools of this wisdom four
      centuries before the Christian era and four centuries after that era.
      Compare the men whom those schools formed at those two periods. Compare
      Plato and Libanius. Compare Pericles and Julian. This philosophy
      confessed, nay boasted, that for every end but one it was useless. Had it
      attained that one end? <span class="pagenum">462</span><a name="link462"
       id="link462"></a>Suppose that Justinian, when he closed the schools of
      Athens, had called on the last few sages who still haunted the Portico,
      and lingered round the ancient plane-trees, to show their title to public
      veneration: suppose that he had said; &ldquo;A thousand years have elapsed
      since, in this famous city, Socrates posed Protagoras and Hippias; during
      those thousand years a large proportion of the ablest men of every
      generation has been employed in constant efforts to bring to perfection
      the philosophy which you teach; that philosophy has been munificently
      patronised by the powerful; its professors have been held in the highest
      esteem by the public; it has drawn to itself almost all the sap and vigour
      of the human intellect: and what has it effected? What profitable truth
      has it taught us which we should not equally have known without it? What
      has it enabled us to do which we should not have been equally able to do
      without it?&rdquo; Such questions, we suspect, would have puzzled Simplicius and
      Isidore. Ask a follower of Bacon what the new philosophy, as it was called
      in the time of Charles the Second, has effected for mankind, and his
      answer is ready; &ldquo;It has lengthened life; it has mitigated pain; it has
      extinguished diseases; it has increased the fertility of the soil; it has
      given new securities to the mariner; it has furnished new arms to the
      warrior; it has spanned great rivers and estuaries with bridges of form
      unknown to our fathers; it has guided the thunderbolt innocuously from
      heaven to earth; it has lighted up the night with the splendour of the
      day; it has extended the range of the human vision; it has multiplied the
      power of the human muscles; it has accelerated motion; it has annihilated
      distance; it has facilitated intercourse, correspondence, all friendly
      offices, all despatch of business; it has <span class="pagenum">463</span><a
      name="link463" id="link463"></a>enabled man to descend to the depths of
      the sea, to soar into the air, to penetrate securely into the noxious
      recesses of the earth, to traverse the land in cars which whirl along
      without horses, and the ocean in ships which run ten knots an hour against
      the wind. These are but a part of its fruits, and of its first fruits. For
      it is a philosophy which never rests, which has never attained, which is
      never perfect. Its law is progress. A point which yesterday was invisible
      is its goal to-day, and will be its starting-post to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Great and various as the powers of Bacon were, he owes his wide and
      durable fame chiefly to this, that all those powers received their
      direction from common sense. His love of the vulgar useful, his strong
      sympathy with the popular notions of good and evil, and the openness with
      which he avowed that sympathy, are the secret of his influence. There was
      in his system no cant, no illusion. He had no anointing for broken hones,
      no fine theories <i>de finibus</i>, no arguments to persuade men out of
      their senses. He knew that men, and philosophers as well as other men, do
      actually love life, health, comfort, honour, security, the society of
      friends, and do actually dislike death, sickness, pain, poverty, disgrace,
      danger, separation from those to whom they are attached. He knew that
      religion, though it often regulates and moderates these feelings, seldom
      eradicates them; nor did he think it desirable for mankind that they
      should be eradicated. The plan of eradicating them by conceits like those
      of Seneca, or syllogisms like those of Chrysippus, was too preposterous to
      be for a moment entertained by a mind like his. He did not understand what
      wisdom there could be in changing names where it was impossible to change
      things; in denying that blindness, hunger, the gout, <span class="pagenum">464</span><a
      name="link464" id="link464"></a>the rack, were evils, and calling them
      [Greek], in refusing to acknowledge that health, safety, plenty, were good
      things, and dubbing them by the name of [Greek]. In his opinions on all
      these subjects, he was not a Stoic, nor an Epicurean, nor an Academic, but
      what would have been called by Stoics, Epicureans, and Academics a mere a
      mere common man. And it was precisely because he was so that his name
      makes so great an era in the history of the world. It was because he dug
      deep that he was able to pile high. It was because, in order to lay his
      foundations, he went down into those parts of human nature which lie low,
      but which are not liable to change, that the fabric which he reared has
      risen to so stately an elevation, and stands with such immovable strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have sometimes thought that an amusing fiction might be written, in
      which a disciple of Epictetus and a disciple of Bacon should be introduced
      as fellow-travellers. They come to a village where the small-pox has just
      begun to rage, and find houses shut up, intercourse suspended, the sick
      abandoned, mothers weeping in terror over their children. The Stoic
      assures the dismayed population that there is nothing bad in the
      small-pox, and that to a wise man, disease, deformity, death, the loss of
      friends, are not evils. The Baconian takes ont a lancet and begins to
      vaccinate. They find a body of miners in great dismay. An explosion of
      noisome vapours has just killed many of those who were at work; and the
      survivors are afraid to venture into the cavern. The Stoic assures them
      that such an accident is nothing but a mere [Greek]. The Baconian, who has
      no such fine word at his command, contents himself with devising a
      safety-lamp. They find a shipwrecked merchant wringing his hands on the
      shore. <span class="pagenum">465</span><a name="link465" id="link465"></a>His
      vessel with an inestimable cargo has just gone down, and lie is reduced in
      a moment from opulence to beggary. The Stoic exhorts him not to seek
      happiness in things which lie without himself, and repeats the whole
      chapter of Epictetus [Greek]. The Baconian constructs a diving-bell, goes
      down in it, and returns with the most precious effects from the wreck. It
      would be easy to multiply illustrations of the difference between the
      philosophy of thorns and the philosophy of fruit, the philosophy of words
      and the philosophy of works.

      Bacon has been accused of overrating the importance of those sciences
      which minister to the physical well-being of man, and of underrating the
      importance of moral philosophy; and it cannot be denied that persons who
      read the <i>Novum Organam</i> and the <i>De Augmentis</i>, without
      adverting to the circumstances under which those works were written, will
      find much that may seem to countenance the accusation. It is certain,
      however, that though in practice he often went very wrong, and though, as
      his historical work and his essays prove, he did not hold, even in theory,
      very strict opinions on points of political morality, he was far too wise
      a man not to know how much our wellbeing depends on the regulation of our
      minds. The world for which he wished was not, as some people seem to
      imagine, a world of water-wheels, power-looms, steam-carriages,
      sensualists, and knaves. He would have been as ready as Zeno himself to
      maintain that no bodily comforts which could be devised by the skill and
      labour of a hundred generations would give happiness to a man whose mind
      was under the tyranny of licentious appetite, of envy, of hatred, or of
      fear. If he sometimes appeared to ascribe importance <span class="pagenum">466</span><a
      name="link466" id="link466"></a>too exclusively to the arts which increase
      the outward comforts of our species, the reason is plain. Those arts had
      been most unduly depreciated. They had been represented as unworthy the
      attention of a man of liberal education. &ldquo;Cogitavit,&rdquo; says Bacon of
      himself, &ldquo;cam esse opinionem sire æstilnationem humidam et dainnosam,
      minni nempe majestatem mentis luminanæ, si in experimentis et rebus
      particularibus, sensui subjectis, et in materia terminatis, din ac multum
      versetur: præsertim cum hujusmodi res ad inquirendum laborioue ad
      meditandum ignobiles, ad discendum asperre, ad practicam illiberales,
      numéro infinitæ, et subtilitate pusillæ videri soleant, et ob hujusmodi
      conditiones, glorio artium minus sint accommodate.&rdquo; (1) This opinion
      seemed to him &ldquo;omnia in familia humana turbasse.&rdquo; It had undoubtedly
      caused many arts which were of the greatest utility, and which were
      susceptible of the greatest improvements, to be neglected by speculators,
      and abandoned to joiners, masons, smiths, weavers, apothecaries. It was
      necessary to assert the dignity of those arts, to bring them prominently
      forward, to proclaim that, as they have a most serious effect on human
      happiness, they are not unworthy of the attention of the highest human
      intellects. Again, it was by illustrations drawn from these arts that
      Bacon could most easily illustrate his principles. It was by improvements
      effected in these arts that the soundness of his principles could be most
      speedily and decisively brought to the test, and made manifest to common
      understandings. He acted like a wise commander who thins every other

     (1) <i>Cogitata</i>. The expression <i>opinio humida</i> may surprise
     a reader not accustomed to Bacon&rsquo;s style. The allusion is to
     the maxim of Heraclitus the obscure: &ldquo;Dry light is the
     best.&rdquo; By dry light, Bacon understood the light of the
     intellect, not obscured by the mists of passion, interest,
     or prejudice

      his line to strengthen a point where the enemy is attacking with peculiar
      fury, and on the fate of which the event of the battle seems likely to
      depend. In the <i>Novum Organum</i>, however, he distinctly and most truly
      declares that his philosophy is no less a Moral than a Natural Philosophy,
      that, though his illustrations are drawn from physical science, the
      principles which those illustrations are intended to explain are just as
      applicable to ethical and political inquiries as to inquiries into the
      nature of heat and vegetation. (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      He frequently treated of moral subjects; and he brought to those subjects
      that spirit which was the essence of his whole system. He has left us many
      admirable practicable observations on what he somewhat quaintly called the
      Georgies of the mind, on the mental culture which tends to produce good
      dispositions. Some persons, he said, might accuse him of spending labour
      on a matter so simple that his predecessors had passed it by with
      contempt. He desired such persons to remember that he had from the first
      announced the objects of his search to be not the splendid and the
      surprising, but the useful and the true, not the deluding dreams which go
      forth through the shining portal of ivory, but the humbler realities of
      the gate of horn. (2)
    </p>
    <p>
      True to this principle, he indulged in no rants about the fitness of
      things, the all-sufficiency of virtue, and the dignity of human nature. He
      dealt not at all in resounding nothings, such as those with which
      Boling-broke pretended to comfort himself in exile, and in which Cicero
      vainly sought consolation after the loss of Tullia. The casuistical
      subtilties which occupied the

      of the keenest spirits of his age had, it should seem, no attractions for
      him. The doctors whom Escobar afterwards compared to the four beasts and
      the four-and-twenty elders in the Apocalypse Bacon dismissed with most
      contemptuous brevity. &ldquo;Inanes plerumque evadunt et futiles.&rdquo; (1) Nor did
      he ever meddle with those enigmas which have puzzled hundreds of
      generations, and will puzzle hundreds more. He said nothing about the
      grounds of moral obligation, or the freedom of the human will. He had no
      inclination to employ himself in labours resembling those of the damned in
      the Grecian Tartarus, to spin for ever on the same wheel round the same
      pivot, to gape for ever after the same deluding clusters, to pour water
      for ever into the same bottomless buckets, to pace for ever to and fro on
      the same wearisome path after the same recoiling stone. He exhorted his
      disciples to prosecute researches of a very different description, to
      consider moral science as a practical science, a science of which the
      object was to cure the diseases and perturbations of the mind, and which
      could be improved only by a method analogous to that which has improved
      medicine and surgery. Moral philosophers ought, he said, to set themselves
      vigorously to work for the purpose of discovering what are the actual
      effects produced on the human character by particular modes of education,
      by the indulgence of particular habits, by the study of particular books,
      by society, by emulation, by imitation. Then we might hope to find out
      what mode of training was most likely to preserve and restore moral
      health. (2)

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">469</span><a name="link469" id="link469"></a>we are
      convinced, a sincere believer in the divine authority of the Christian
      revelation. Nothing can be found in his writings, or in any other
      writings, more eloquent and pathetic than some passages which were
      apparently written under the influence of strong devotional feeling. He
      loved to dwell on the power of the Christian religion to effect much that
      the ancient philosophers could only promise. He loved to consider that
      religion as the bond of charity, the curb of evil passions, the
      consolation of the wretched, the support of the timid, the hope of the
      dying. But controversies on speculative points of theology seem to have
      engaged scarcely any portion of his attention. In what he wrote on Church
      Government he showed, as far as he dared, a tolerant and charitable
      spirit. He troubled himself not at all about Homoousians and Homoionsians,
      Monothelites and Nestorians. He lived in an age in which disputes on the
      most subtle points of divinity excited an intense interest throughout
      Europe, and nowhere more than in England. He was placed in the very thick
      of the conflict. He was in power at the time of the Synod of Dort, and
      must for months have been daily deafened with talk about election,
      reprobation, and final perseverance. Yet we do not remember a line in his
      works from which it can be inferred that he was either a Calvinist or an
      Arminian. While the world was resounding with the noise of a disputatious
      philosophy and a disputatious theology, the Baconian school, like Alworthy
      seated between Square and Thwackum, preserved a calm neutrality, half
      scornful, half benevolent, and, content with adding to the sum of
      practical good, left the war of words to those who liked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have dwelt long on the end of the Baconian <span class="pagenum">470</span><a
      name="link470" id="link470"></a>philosophy, because from this peculiarity
      all the other peculiarities of that philosophy necessarily arose. Indeed,
      scarcely any person who proposed to himself the same end with Bacon could
      fail to hit upon the same means.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vulgar notion about Bacon we take to be this, that he invented a new
      method of arriving at truth, which method is called Induction, and that he
      detected some fallacy in the syllogistic reasoning which had been in vogue
      before his time. This notion is about as well founded as that of the
      people who, in the middle ages, imagined that Virgil was a great conjurer.
      Many who are far too well informed to talk such extravagant nonsense
      entertain what we think incorrect notions as to what Bacon really effected
      in this matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inductive method has been practised ever since the beginning of the
      world by every human being. It is constantly practised by the most
      ignorant clown, by the most thoughtless schoolboy, by the very child at
      the breast. That method leads the clown to the conclusion that if he sows
      barley he shall not reap wheat. By that method the schoolboy learns that a
      cloudy day is the best for catching trout. The very infant, we imagine, is
      led by induction to expect milk from his mother or nurse, and none from
      his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only is it not true that Bacon invented the inductive method; but it
      is not true that he was the first person who correctly analysed that
      method and explained its uses. Aristotle had long before pointed out the
      absurdity of supposing that syllogistic reasoning could ever conduct men
      to the discovery of any new principle, had shown that such discoveries
      must be made by induction, and by induction alone, and had given the
      history of the inductive process, concisely indeed, but with great
      perspicuity and precision. <span class="pagenum">471</span><a
      name="link471" id="link471"></a>Again, we are not inclined to ascribe much
      practical value to that analysis of the inductive method which Bacon has
      given in the second book of the <i>Novum Organum</i>. It is indeed an
      elaborate and correct analysis. But it is an analysis of that which we are
      all doing from morning to night, and which we continue to do even in our
      dreams. A plain man finds his stomach out of order. He never heard Lord
      Bacon&rsquo;s name. But he proceeds in the strictest conformity with the rules
      laid down in the second book of the Novum Organum, and satisfies himself
      that minced pies have done the mischief. &ldquo;I ate minced pies on Monday and
      Wednesday, and I was kept awake by indigestion all night.&rdquo; This is the
      comparentia ad intellectual instantiarum convenientium. &ldquo;I did not eat any
      on Tuesday and Friday, and I was quite well.&rdquo; This is the comparentia
      instantiarum in proximo qua natura data privantur. &ldquo;I ate very sparingly
      of them on Sunday, and was very slightly indisposed in the evening. But on
      Christmas-day I almost dined on them, and was so ill that I was in great
      danger.&rdquo; This is the <i>comparentia instantiarum secundum magis et minus</i>.
      &ldquo;It cannot have been the brandy which I took with them. For I have drunk
      brandy daily for years without being the worse for it.&rdquo; This is the <i>rejectio
      naturarum</i>. Our invalid then proceeds to what is termed by Bacon the <i>Vindemiatio</i>,
      and pronounces that minced pies do not agree with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We repeat that we dispute neither the ingenuity nor the accuracy of the
      theory contained in the second book of the <i>Novum Organum</i>; but we
      think that Bacon greatly overrated its utility. We conceive that the
      inductive process, like many other processes, is not likely to be better
      performed merely because men know <span class="pagenum">472</span><a
      name="link472" id="link472"></a>how they perform it. William Tell would
      not have been one whit more likely to cleave the apple if he had known
      that his arrow would describe a parabola under the influence of the
      attraction of the earth. Captain Barclay would not have been more likely
      to walk a thousand miles in a thousand hours, if he had known the place
      and name of every muscle in his legs. Monsieur Jourdain probably did not
      pronounce D and F more correctly after he had been apprised that D is
      pronounced by touching the teeth with the end of the tongue, and F by
      putting the upper teeth on the lower lip. We cannot perceive that the
      study of Grammar makes the smallest difference in the speech of people who
      have always lived in good society. Not one Londoner in ten thousand can
      lay down the rules for the proper use of will and shall. Yet not one
      Londoner in a million ever misplaces his will and shall. Doctor Robertson
      could, undoubtedly, have written a luminous dissertation on the use of&rsquo;
      those words. Yet, even in his latest work, he sometimes misplaced them
      ludicrously. No man uses figures of speech with more propriety because he
      knows that one figure is called a metonymy and another a synecdoche. A
      drayman in a passion calls out, &ldquo;You are a pretty fellow,&rdquo; without
      suspecting that he is uttering irony, and that irony is one of the four
      primary tropes. The old systems of rhetoric were never regarded by the
      most experienced and discerning judges as of any use for the purpose of
      forming an orator-&ldquo;Ego liane vim intelligo,&rdquo; said Cicero, &ldquo;esse in
      præceptis omnibus, non ut ea secuti oratores eloquentiæ landem sint
      adepti, sed quæ sua sponte homines éloquentes facerent, ea quosdam
      observasse, atque id egisse; sic esse non eloquentiam ex artificio, sed
      artificium ex eloqnentia natum.&rdquo; We must own that we <span class="pagenum">473</span><a
      name="link473" id="link473"></a>entertain the same opinion concerning the
      study of Logic which Cicero entertained concerning the study of Rhetoric.
      A man of sense syllogizes in <i>celarent</i> and sesare all day long
      without suspecting it; and, though he may not know what an <i>ignoratio
      clenchi</i> is, has no difficulty in exposing it whenever he falls in with
      it; which is likely to be as often as he falls in with a Reverend Master
      of Arts nourished on mode and figure in the cloisters of Oxford.
      Considered merely as an intellectual feat, the <i>Organum</i> of Aristotle
      can scarcely be admired too highly. But the more we compare individual
      with individual, school with school, nation with nation, generation with
      generation, the more do we lean to the opinion that the knowledge of the
      theory of logic has no tendency whatever to make men good reasoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Aristotle did for the syllogistic process Bacon has, in the second
      book of the <i>Novum Organum</i>, done for the inductive process; that is
      to say, he has analysed it well. His rules are quite proper; but we do not
      need them, because they are drawn from our own constant practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, though everybody is constantly performing the process described in
      the second book of the <i>Novum Organum</i>, some men perform it well and
      some perform it ill. Some are led by it to truth, and some to error. It
      led Franklin to discover the nature of lightning. It led thousands, who
      had less brains than Franklin, to believe in animal magnetism. But this
      was not because Franklin went through the process described by Bacon, and
      the dupes of Mesmer through a different process. The <i>comparentiæ</i>
      and <i>rejectiones</i> of which we have given examples will be found in
      the most unsound inductions. We have heard that an eminent judge of <span
      class="pagenum">474</span><a name="link474" id="link474"></a>the last
      generation was in the habit of jocosely propounding after dinner a theory,
      that the cause of the prevalence of Jacobinism was the practice of bearing
      three names. He quoted on the one side Charles James Fox, Richard Brinsley
      Sheridan, John Horne Tooke, John Philpot Curran, Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
      Theobald Wolfe Tone. These were <i>instantiae convenientes</i>. He then
      proceeded to cite instances <i>absentio in proximo</i>, William Pitt, John
      Scott, William Windham, Samuel Horsley, Henry Dundas, Edmund Burke. He
      might have gone on to instances <i>secundum magis et minus</i>. The
      practice of giving children three names has been for some time a growing
      practice, and Jacobinism has also been growing. The practice of giving
      children three names is more common in America than in England. In England
      we still have a King and a House of Lords; but the Americans are
      republicans. The rejectiones are obvious. Burke and Theobald Wolfe Tone
      are both Irishmen; therefore the being an Irishman is not the cause of
      Jacobinism. Horsley and Horne Tooke are both clergymen; therefore the
      being a clergyman is not the cause of Jacobinism. Fox and Windham were
      both educated at Oxford; therefore the being educated at Oxford is not the
      cause of Jacobinism. Pitt and Horne Tooke were both educated at Cambridge;
      therefore the being educated at Cambridge is not the cause of Jacobinism.
      In this way, our inductive philosopher arrives at what Bacon calls the
      Vintage, and pronounces that the having three names is the cause of
      Jacobinism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an induction corresponding with Bacon&rsquo;s analysis and ending in a
      monstrous absurdity. In what then does this induction differ from the
      induction which leads us to the conclusion that the presence <span
      class="pagenum">475</span><a name="link475" id="link475"></a>of the sun is
      the cause of our having more light by day than by night? The difference
      evidently is not in the kind of instances, but in the number of instances;
      that is to say, the difference is not in that part of the process for
      which Bacon has given precise rules, but in a circumstance for which no
      precise rule can possibly be given. If the learned author of the theory
      about Jacobinism had enlarged either of his tables a little, his system
      would have been destroyed. The names of Tom Paine and William Wyndham
      Grenville would have been sufficient to do the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears to us, then, that the difference between a sound and unsound
      induction does not lie in this, that the author of the sound induction
      goes through the process analysed in the second book of the <i>Novum
      Organum</i>, and the author of the unsound induction through a different
      process. They both perform the same process. But one performs it foolishly
      or carelessly; the other performs it with patience, attention, sagacity,
      and judgment. Now precepts can do little towards making men patient and
      attentive, and still less towards making them sagacious and judicious. It
      is very well to tell men to be on their guard against prejudices, not to
      believe facts on slight evidence, not to be content with a scanty
      collection of facts, to put out of their minds the <i>idola</i> which
      Bacon has so finely described. But these rules are too general to be of
      much practical use. The question is, What is a prejudice? How long does
      the incredulity with which I hear a new theory propounded continue to be a
      wise and salutary incredulity? When does it become an <i>idolum specus</i>,
      the unreasonable pertinacity of a too sceptical mind? What is slight
      evidence? What collection of facts is scanty? Will ten instances do, or
      fifty, or a hundred? In how many <span class="pagenum">476</span><a
      name="link476" id="link476"></a>months would the first human beings who
      settled on the shores of the ocean have been justified in believing that
      the moon had an influence on the tides? After how many experiments would
      Jenner have been justified in believing that he had discovered a safeguard
      against the small-pox? These are questions to which it would be most
      desirable to have a precise answer; but unhappily they are questions to
      which no precise answer can be returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      We think then that it is possible to lay down accurate rules, as Bacon has
      done, for the performing of that part of the inductive process which all
      men perform alike; but that these rules, though accurate, are not wanted,
      because in truth they only tell us to do what we are all doing. We think
      that it is impossible to lay down any precise rule for the performing of
      that part of the inductive process which a great experimental philosopher
      performs in one way, and a superstitious old woman in another.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this subject, we think, Bacon was in an error. He certainly attributed
      to his rules a value which did not belong to them. He went so far as to
      say, that, if his method of making discoveries were adopted, little would
      depend on the degree of force or acuteness of any intellect; that all
      minds would be reduced to one level, that his philosophy resembled a
      compass or a rule which equalises all hands, and enables the most
      unpractised person to draw a more correct circle or line than the best
      draughtsmen can produce without such aid. (1) This really seems to us as
      extravagant as it would have been in Lindley Murray to announce that
      everybody who should learn his Grammar would write as good English as
      Dryden, or in that very able writer,

      Archbishop of Dublin, to promise that all the readers of his Logic would
      reason like Chillingworth, and that all the readers of his Rhetoric would
      speak like Burke. That Bacon was altogether mistaken as to this point will
      now hardly be disputed. His philosophy has flourished during two hundred
      years, and has produced none of this levelling. The interval between a man
      of talents and a dunce is as wide as ever; and is never more clearly
      discernible than when they engage in researches which require the constant
      use of induction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be seen that we do not consider Bacon&rsquo;s ingenious analysis of the
      inductive method as a very useful performance. Bacon was not, as we have
      already said, the inventor of the inductive method. He was not even the
      person who first analysed the inductive method correctly, though he
      undoubtedly analysed it more minutely than any who preceded him. He was
      not the person who first showed that by the inductive method alone new
      truth could be discovered. But he was the person who first turned the
      minds of speculative men, long occupied in verbal disputes, to the
      discovery of new and useful truth; and, by doing so, he at once gave to
      the inductive method an importance and dignity which had never before
      belonged to it. He was not the maker of that road; he was not the
      discoverer of that road; he was not the person who first surveyed and
      mapped that road. But he was the person who first called the public
      attention to an inexhaustible mine of wealth, which had been utterly
      neglected, and which was accessible by that road alone. By doing so, he
      caused that road, which had previously been trodden only by peasants and
      higglers, to be frequented by a higher class of travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      That which was eminently his own in his system <span class="pagenum">478</span><a
      name="link478" id="link478"></a>was the end which he proposed to himself.
      The end being given, the means, as it appears to us, could not well be
      mistaken. If others had aimed at the same object with Bacon, we hold it to
      be certain that they would have employed the same method with Bacon. It
      would have been hard to convince Seneca that the inventing of a
      safety-lamp was an employment worthy of a philosopher. It would have been
      hard to persuade Thomas Aquinas to descend from the making of syllogisms
      to the making of gunpowder. But Seneca would never have doubted for a
      moment that it was only by means of a series of experiments that a
      safety-lamp could be invented. Thomas Aquinas would never have thought
      that his <i>barbara</i> and <i>baralipton</i> would enable him to
      ascertain the proportion which charcoal ought to bear to saltpetre in a
      pound of gunpowder. Neither common sense nor Aristotle would have suffered
      him to fall into such an absurdity.
    </p>
    <p>
      By stimulating men to the discovery of new truth, Bacon stimulated them to
      employ the inductive method, the only method, even the ancient
      philosophers and the schoolmen themselves being judges, by which new truth
      can be discovered. By stimulating men to the discovery of useful truth, he
      furnished them with a motive to perform the inductive process well and
      carefully. His predecessors had been, in his phrase, not interpreters, but
      anticipators of nature. They had been content with the first principles at
      which they had arrived by the most scanty and slovenly induction. And why
      was this? It was, we conceive, because their philosophy proposed to itself
      no practical end, because it was merely an exercise of the mind. A man who
      wants to contrive a new machine or a new medicine has a strong motive to
      observe accurately and <span class="pagenum">479</span><a name="link479"
       id="link479"></a>patiently, and to try experiment after experiment. But a
      man who merely wants a theme for disputation or declamation has no such
      motive. He is therefore content with premises grounded on assumption, or
      on the most scanty and hasty induction. Thus, we conceive, the schoolmen
      acted. On their foolish premises they often argued with great ability; and
      as their object was &ldquo;assensum subjugare, non res,&rdquo; (1) to be victorious in
      controversy, not to be victorious over nature, they were consistent. For
      just as much logical skill could be shown in reasoning on false as on true
      premises. But the followers of the new philosophy, proposing to themselves
      the discovery of useful truth as their object, must have altogether failed
      of attaining that object if they had been content to build theories on
      superficial induction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon has remarked (2) that in ages when philosophy was stationary, the
      mechanical arts went on improving. Why was this? Evidently because the
      mechanic was not content with so careless a mode of induction as served
      the purpose of the philosopher. And why was the philosopher more easily
      satisfied than the mechanic? Evidently because the object of the mechanic
      was to mould things, whilst the object of the philosopher was only to
      mould words. Careful induction is not at all necessary to the making of a
      good syllogism. But it is indispensable to the making of a good shoe.
      Mechanics, therefore, have always been, as far as the range of their
      humble but useful callings extended, not anticipators but interpreters of
      nature. And when a philosophy arose, the object of which was to do on a
      large scale what the mechanic does on a small scale, to

      the power and to supply the wants of man, the truth of the premises, which
      logically is a matter altogether unimportant, became a matter of the
      highest importance; and the careless induction with which men of learning
      had previously been satisfied gave place, of necessity, to an induction
      far more accurate and satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Bacon did for inductive philosophy may, we think, be fairly stated
      thus. The objects of preceding speculators were objects which could be
      attained without careful induction. Those speculators, therefore, did not
      perform the inductive process carefully. Bacon stirred up men to pursue an
      object which could be attained only by induction, and by induction
      carefully performed; and consequently induction was more carefully
      performed. We do not think that the importance of what Bacon did for
      inductive philosophy has ever been overrated. But we think that the nature
      of his services is often mistaken, and was not fully understood even by
      himself. It was not by furnishing philosophers with rules for performing
      the inductive process well, but by furnishing them with a motive for
      performing it well, that he conferred so vast a benefit on society.

      To give to the human mind a direction which it shall retain for ages is
      the rare prerogative of a few imperial spirits. It cannot, therefore, be
      uninteresting to inquire what was the moral and intellectual constitution
      which enabled Bacon to exercise so vast an influence on the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the temper of Bacon,&mdash;we speak of Bacon the philosopher, not of
      Bacon the lawyer and politician,&mdash;there was a singular union of
      audacity and sobriety. The promises which he made to mankind might, to a
      superficial reader, seem to resemble the rants which a <span
      class="pagenum">481</span><a name="link481" id="link481"></a>great
      dramatist has put into the mouth of an Oriental conqueror half-crazed by

      But Bacon performed what he promised. In truth, Fletcher would not have
      dared to make Arbaces promise, in his wildest fits of excitement, the
      tithe of what the Baconian philosophy has performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The true philosophical temperament may, we think, be described in four
      words, much hope, little faith; a disposition to believe that any thing,
      however extraordinary, may be done; an indisposition to believe that any
      thing extraordinary has been done. In these points the constitution of
      Bacon&rsquo;s mind seems to us to have been absolutely perfect. He was at once
      the Mammon and the Surly of his friend Ben. Sir Epicure did not indulge in
      visions more magnificent and gigantic. Surly did not sift evidence with
      keener and more sagacious incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Closely connected with this peculiarity of Bacon&rsquo;s temper was a striking
      peculiarity of his understanding. With great minuteness of observation he
      had an amplitude of comprehension such as has never yet been vouchsafed to
      any other human being. The small fine mind of Labruyère had not a more
      delicate tact than the large intellect of Bacon. The Essays contain
      abundant proofs that no nice feature of character, no peculiarity in the
      ordering of a house, a garden, or a court-masque, could escape the notice
      of one whose <span class="pagenum">482</span><a name="link482" id="link482"></a>mind
      was capable of taking in the whole world of knowledge. His understanding
      resembled the tent which the fairy Paribanou gave to Prince Ahmed. Fold
      it; and it seemed a toy for the hand of a lady. Spread it; and the armies
      of powerful Sultans might repose beneath its shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      In keenness of observation he has been equalled, though perhaps never
      surpassed. But the largeness of his mind was all his own. The glance with
      which he surveyed the intellectual universe resembled that which the
      Archangel, from the golden threshold of heaven, darted down into the new
      creation. <br /><br /><span class="indent15">&rsquo;Round he surveyed,&mdash;and
      well might, where he stood <br /><span class="indent15">So high above the

      His knowledge differed from that of other men, as a terrestrial globe
      differs from an Atlas which contains a different country on every leaf.
      The towns and roads of England, France, and Germany are better laid down
      in the Atlas than on the globe. But while we are looking at England we see
      nothing of France; and while we are looking at France we see nothing of
      Germany. We may go to the Atlas to learn the bearings and distances of
      York and Bristol, or of Dresden and Prague. But it is useless if we want
      to know the bearings and distances of France and Martinique, or of England
      and Canada. On the globe we shall not find all the market towns in our own
      neighbourhood; but we shall learn from it the comparative extent and the
      relative position of all the kingdoms of the earth. &ldquo;I have taken,&rdquo; said
      Bacon, in a letter <span class="pagenum">483</span><a name="link483"
       id="link483"></a>written when he was only thirty-one, to his uncle Lord
      Burleigh, &ldquo;I have taken all knowledge to be my province.&rdquo; In any other
      young man, indeed in any other man, this would have been a ridiculous
      flight of presumption. There have been thousands of better mathematicians,
      astronomers, chemists, physicians, botanists, mineralogists, than Bacon.
      No man would go to Bacon&rsquo;s works to learn any particular science or art,
      any more than he would go to a twelve-inch globe in order to find his way
      from Kennington turnpike to Clapham Common. The art which Bacon taught was
      the art of inventing arts. The knowledge in which Bacon excelled all men
      was a knowledge of the mutual relations of all departments of knowledge.

    <p>
      The mode in which he communicated his thoughts was peculiar to him. He had
      no touch of that disputatious temper which he often censured in his
      predecessors. He effected a vast intellectual revolution in opposition to
      a vast mass of prejudices; yet he never engaged in any controversy: nay,
      we cannot at present recollect, in all his philosophical works, a single
      passage of a controversial character. All those works might with propriety
      have been put into the form which he adopted in the work entitled <i>Cogitata
      et visa</i>: &ldquo;Francisons Baconus sic cogitavit.&rdquo; These are thoughts which
      have occurred to me: weigh them well: and take them or leave them.

    <p>
      Borgia said of the famous expedition of Charles the Eighth, that the
      French had conquered Italy, not with steel, but with chalk; for that the
      only exploit which they had found necessary for the purpose of taking
      military occupation of any place had been to mark the doors of the houses
      where they meant to quarter. Bacon often quoted this saying, and loved to
      apply it <span class="pagenum">484</span><a name="link484" id="link484"></a>to
      the victories of his own intellect. (1) His philosophy, he said, came as a
      guest, not as an enemy. She found no difficulty in gaining admittance,
      without a contest, into every understanding fitted, by its structure and
      by its capacity, to receive her. In all this we think that he acted most
      judiciously; first, because, as he has himself remarked, the difference
      between his school and other schools was a difference so fundamental that
      there was hardly any common ground on which a controversial battle could
      be fought; and, secondly, because his mind, eminently observant,
      preeminently discursive and capacious, was, we conceive, neither formed by
      nature nor disciplined by habit for dialectical combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Bacon did not arm his philosophy with the weapons of logic, he
      adorned her profusely with all the richest decorations of rhetoric. His
      eloquence, though not untainted with the vicious taste of his age, would
      alone have entitled him to a high rank in literature. He had a wonderful
      talent for packing thought close, and rendering it portable. In wit, if by
      wit be meant the power of perceiving analogies between things which appear
      to have nothing in common, he never had an equal, not even Cowley, not
      even the author of Hudibras. Indeed, he possessed this faculty, or rather
      this faculty possessed him, to a morbid degree. When he abandoned himself
      to it without reserve, as he did in the <i>Sapientia Veterum</i>, and at
      the end of the second book of the <i>De Augmentis</i>, the feats which he
      performed were not merely admirable, but portentous, and almost shocking.
      On these occasions we marvel at him as clowns on a fair-day marvel at a
      juggler, and can hardly help thinking that the devil must be in him.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">485</span><a name="link485" id="link485"></a>These,
      however, were freaks in which his ingenuity now and then wantoned, with
      scarcely any other object than to astonish and amuse. But it occasionally
      happened that, when he was engaged in grave and profound investigations,
      his wit obtained the mastery over all his other faculties, and led him
      into absurdities into which no dull man could possibly have fallen. We
      will give the most striking instance which at present occurs to us. In the
      third book of the <i>De Augmentis</i> he tells us that there are some
      principles which are not peculiar to one science, but are common to
      several. That part of philosophy which concerns itself with these
      principles is, in his nomenclature, designated as <i>philosophia prima</i>.
      He then proceeds to mention some of the principles with which this <i>philosophia
      prima</i> is conversant. One of them is this. An infectious disease is
      more likely to be communicated while it is in progress than when it has
      reached its height. This, says he, is true in medicine. It is also true in
      morals; for we see that the example of very abandoned men injures public
      morality less than the example of men in whom vice has not yet
      extinguished all good qualities. Again, he tells us that in music a
      discord ending in a concord is agreeable, and that the same thing may be
      noted in the affections. Once more, he tells us, that in physics the
      energy with which a principle acts is often increased by the
      antiperistasis of its opposite; and that it is the same in the contests of
      factions. If the making of ingenious and sparkling similitudes like these
      be indeed the <i>philosophia prima</i>, we are quite sure that the
      greatest philosophical work of the nineteenth century is Mr. Moore&rsquo;s Lalla
      Rookh. The similitudes which we have cited are very happy similitudes. But
      that a man like Bacon should have taken them for more, that he should have
      thought the <span class="pagenum">486</span><a name="link486" id="link486"></a>discovery
      of such resemblances as these an important part of philosophy, has always
      appeared to us one of the most singular facts in the history of letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is that his mind was wonderfully quick in perceiving analogies
      of all sorts. But, like several eminent men whom we could name, both
      living and dead, he sometimes appeared strangely deficient in the power of
      distinguishing rational from fanciful analogies, analogies which are
      arguments from analogies which are mere illustrations, analogies like that
      which Bishop Butler so ably pointed out, between natural and revealed
      religion, from analogies like that which Addison discovered, between the
      series of Grecian gods carved by Phidias and the series of English kings
      painted by Kneller. This want of discrimination has led to many strange
      political speculations. Sir William Temple deduced a theory of government
      from the properties of the pyramid. Mr. Southey&rsquo;s whole system of finance
      is grounded on the phænomena of evaporation and rain. In theology, this
      perverted ingenuity has made still wilder work. From the time of Iremeus
      and Origen down to the present day, there has not been a single generation
      in which great divines have not been led into the most absurd expositions
      of Scripture, by mere incapacity to distinguish analogies proper, to use
      the scholastic phrase, from analogies metaphorical. (1) It is curious that
      Bacon has himself mentioned this very kind of delusion among the <i>idola
      specus</i>; and has mentioned in language which, we are inclined to think,
      shows that he knew himself to be subject to it. It is the vice, he tells
      us, of subtle minds to attach too much importance to slight distinctions;
      it, is the vice, on the other hand, of high and discursive
    </p>

      <span class="pagenum">487</span><a name="link487" id="link487"></a>intellects
      to attach too much importance to slight resemblances; and he adds that,
      when this last propensity is indulged to excess, it leads men to catch at
      shadows instead of substances. (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet we cannot wish that Bacon&rsquo;s wit had been less luxuriant. For, to say
      nothing of the pleasure which it affords, it was in the vast majority of
      cases employed for the purpose of making obscure truth plain, of making
      repulsive truth attractive, of fixing in the mind forever truth which
      might otherwise have left but a transient impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poetical faculty was powerful in Bacon&rsquo;s mind, but not, like his wit,
      so powerful as occasionally to usurp the place of his reason, and to
      tyrannize over the whole man. No imagination was ever at once so strong
      and so thoroughly subjugated. It never stirred but at a signal from good
      sense. It stopped at the first check from good sense. Yet, though
      disciplined to such obedience, it gave noble proofs of its vigour. In
      truth, much of Bacon&rsquo;s life was passed in a visionary world, amidst things
      as strange as any that are described in the Arabian Tales, or in those
      romances on which the curate and barber of Don Quixote&rsquo;s village performed
      so cruel an auto-de-fe, amidst buildings more sumptuous than the palace of
      Aladdin, fountains more wonderful than the golden water of Parizade,
      conveyances more rapid than the hippogryph of Ruggiero, arms more
      formidable than the lance of Astolfo, remedies more efficacious than the
      balsam of Fierabras. Yet in his magnificent day-dreams there was nothing
      wild, nothing but what sober reason sanctioned. He knew that all the
      secrets feigned by poets to have been written in the books of enchanters
      are worthless when compared

      <span class="pagenum">488</span><a name="link488" id="link488"></a>with
      the mighty secrets which are really written in the book of nature, and
      which, with time and patience, will be read there. He knew that all the
      wonders wrought by all the talismans in fable were trifles when compared
      to the wonders which might reasonably be expected from the philosophy of
      fruit, and that, if his words sank deep into the minds of men, they would
      produce effects such as superstition had never ascribed to the
      incantations of Merlin and Michael Scot. It was here that he loved to let
      his imagination loose. He loved to picture to himself the world as it
      would be when his philosophy should, in his own noble phrase, &ldquo;have
      enlarged the bounds of human empire.&rdquo; (1) We might refer to many
      instances. But we will content ourselves with the strongest, the
      description of the House of Solomon in the New Atlantis. By most of
      Bacon&rsquo;s contemporaries, and by some people of our time, this remarkable
      passage would, we doubt not, be considered as an ingenious rodomontade, a
      counterpart to the adventures of Sinbad or Baron Munchausen. The truth is,
      that there is not to be found in any human composition a passage more
      eminently distinguished by profound and serene wisdom. The boldness and
      originality of the fiction is far less wonderful than the nice discernment
      which carefully excluded from that long list of prodigies every thing that
      can be pronounced impossible, every thing that can be proved to lie beyond
      the mighty magic of induction and of time. Already some parts, and not the
      least startling parts, of this glorious prophecy have been accomplished,
      even according to the letter; and the whole, construed according to the

      <span class="pagenum">489</span><a name="link489" id="link489"></a>history
      of Bacon&rsquo;s mind is the order in which its powers expanded themselves. With
      him the fruit came first and remained till the last; the blossoms did not
      appear till late. In general, the development of the fancy is to the
      development of the judgment what the growth of a girl is to the growth of
      a boy. The fancy attains at an earlier period to the perfection of its
      beauty, its power, and its fruitfulness; and, as it is first to ripen, it
      is also first to fade. It has generally lost something of its bloom and
      freshness before the sterner faculties have reached maturity; and is
      commonly withered and barren while those faculties still retain all their
      energy. It rarely happens that the fancy and the judgment grow together.
      It happens still more rarely that the judgment grows faster than the
      fancy. This seems, however, to have been the case with Bacon. His boyhood
      and youth appear to have been singularly sedate. His gigantic scheme of
      philosophical reform is said by some writers to have been planned before
      he was fifteen, and was undoubtedly planned while he was still young. He
      observed as vigilantly, meditated as deeply, and judged as temperately
      when he gave his first work to the world as at the close of his long
      career. But in eloquence, in sweetness and variety of expression, and in
      richness of illustration, his later writings are far superior to those of
      his youth. In this respect the history of his mind bears some resemblance
      to the history of the mind of Burke. The treatise on the Sublime and
      Beautiful, though written on a subject which the coldest metaphysician
      could hardly treat without being occasionally betrayed into florid
      writing, is the most unadorned of all Burke&rsquo;s works. It appeared when he
      was twenty-five or twenty-six. When, at forty, he wrote the Thoughts on
      the Causes of the existing Discontents, <span class="pagenum">490</span><a
      name="link490" id="link490"></a>his reason and his judgment had readied
      their full maturity; but his eloquence was still in its splendid dawn. At
      fifty, his rhetoric was quite as rich as good taste would permit; and when
      he died, at almost seventy, it had become ungracefully gorgeous. In his
      youth he wrote on the emotions produced by mountains and cascades, by the
      master-pieces of painting and sculpture, by the faces and necks of
      beautiful women, in the style of a Parliamentary report. In his old age he
      discussed treaties and tariffs in the most fervid and brilliant language
      of romance. It is strange that the Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful, and
      the Letter to a Noble Lord, should be the productions of one man. But it
      is far more strange that the Essay should have been a production of his
      youth, and the Letter of his old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will give very short specimens of Bacon&rsquo;s two styles. In 1597, he wrote
      thus: &ldquo;Crafty men contemn studies; simple men admire them; and wise men
      use them; for they teach not their own use: that is a wisdom without them,
      and won by observation. Read not to contradict, nor to believe, but to
      weigh and consider. Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed,
      and some few to be chewed and digested. Reading maketh a full man,
      conference a ready man, and writing an exact man. And therefore if a man
      write little, he had need have a great memory; if he confer little, have a
      present wit; and if he read little, have much cunning to seem to know that
      he doth not. Histories make men wise, poets witty, the mathematics subtle,
      natural philosophy deep, morals grave, logic and rhetoric able to
      contend,&rdquo; It will hardly be disputed that this is a passage to be &ldquo;chewed
      and digested.&rdquo; We do not believe that Thucydides himself <span
      class="pagenum">491</span><a name="link491" id="link491"></a>has anywhere
      compressed so much thought into so small a space.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the additions which Bacon afterwards made to the Essays, there is
      nothing superior in truth or weight to what we have quoted. But his style
      was constantly becoming richer and softer. The following passage, first
      published in 1625, will show the extent of the change: &ldquo;Prosperity is the
      blessing of the Old Testament; adversity is the blessing of the New, which
      carrieth the greater benediction and the clearer evidence of God&rsquo;s favour.
      Yet, even in the Old Testament, if you listen to David&rsquo;s harp you shall
      hear as many hearse-like airs as carols; and the pencil of the Holy Ghost
      hath laboured more in describing the afflictions of Job than the
      felicities of Solomon. Prosperity is not without many fears and distastes;
      and adversity is not without comforts and hopes. We see in needleworks and
      embroideries it is more pleasing to have a lively work upon a sad and
      solemn ground, than to have a dark and melancholy work upon a lightsome
      ground. Judge therefore of the pleasure of the heart by the pleasure of
      the eye. Certainly virtue is like precious odours, most fragrant when they
      are incensed or crushed; for prosperity doth best discover vice, but
      adversity doth best discover virtue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is by the Essays that Bacon is best known to the multitude. The <i>Novum
      Organum</i> and the <i>De Augmentis</i> are much talked of, but little
      read. They have produced indeed a vast effect on the opinions of mankind;
      but they have produced it through the operation of intermediate agents.
      They have moved the intellects which have moved the world. It is in the
      Essays alone that the mind of Bacon is brought into immediate contact with
      the minds of ordinary readers. There he <span class="pagenum">492</span><a
      name="link492" id="link492"></a>opens an exoteric school, and talks to
      plain men, in language which everybody understands, about things in which
      everybody is interested. He has thus enabled those who must otherwise have
      taken his merits on trust to judge for themselves; and the great body of
      readers have, during several generations, acknowledged that the man who
      has treated with such consummate ability questions with which they are
      familiar may well be supposed to deserve all the praise bestowed on him by
      those who have sat in his inner school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without any disparagement to the admirable treatise <i>De Augmentis</i>,
      we must say that, in our judgment, Bacon&rsquo;s greatest performance is the
      first book of the <i>Novum Organum</i>. All the peculiarities of his
      extraordinary mind are found there in the highest perfection. Many of the
      aphorisms, but particularly those in which he gives examples of the
      influence of the <i>idola</i>, show a nicety of observation that has never
      been surpassed. Every part of the book blazes with wit, but with wit which
      is employed only to illustrate and decorate truth. No book ever made so
      great a revolution in the mode of thinking, overthrew so many prejudices,
      introduced so many new opinions. Yet no book was ever written in a less
      contentious spirit. It truly conquers with chalk and not with steel.
      Proposition after proposition enters into the mind, is received not as an
      invader, but as a welcome friend, and though previously unknown, becomes
      at once domesticated. But what we most admire is the vast capacity of that
      intellect which, without effort, takes in at once all the domains of
      science, all the past, the present, and the future, all the errors of two
      thousand years, all the encouraging signs of the passing times, all the
      bright hopes of the coming age. Cowley, who was among the most ardent, and
      not <span class="pagenum">493</span><a name="link493" id="link493"></a>among
      the least discerning followers of the new philosophy, has, in one of his
      finest poems, compared Bacon to Moses standing on Mount Pisgah. It is to
      Bacon, we think, as he appears in the first book of the <i>Novum Organum</i>,
      that the comparison applies with peculiar felicity. There we see the great
      Lawgiver looking round from his lonely elevation on an infinite expanse;
      behind him a wilderness of dreary sands, and bitter waters, in which
      successive generations have sojourned, always moving, yet never advancing,
      reaping no harvest, and building no abiding city; before him a goodly
      land, a land of promise, a land flowing with milk and honey. While the
      multitude below saw only the flat sterile desert in which they had so long
      wandered, bounded on every side by a near horizon, or diversified only by
      some deceitful mirage, he was gazing from a far higher stand on a far
      lovelier country, following with his eye the long course of fertilising
      rivers, through ample pastures, and under the bridges of great capitals,
      measuring the distances of marts and havens, and portioning out all those
      wealthy regions from Dan to Beersheba.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is painful to turn back from contemplating Bacon&rsquo;s philosophy to
      contemplate his life. Yet without so turning back it is impossible fairly
      to estimate his powers. He left the University at an earlier age than that
      at which most people repair thither. While yet a boy he was plunged into
      the midst of diplomatic business. Thence he passed to the study of a vast
      technical system of law, and worked his way up through a succession of
      laborious offices, to the highest post in his profession. In the mean time
      he took an active part in every Parliament; he was an adviser of the
      Crown: he paid court with the greatest assiduity and address to <span
      class="pagenum">494</span><a name="link494" id="link494"></a>all whose
      favour was likely to be of use to him; he lived much in society; he noted
      the slightest peculiarities of character, and the slightest changes of
      fashion. Scarcely any man has led a more stirring life than that which
      Bacon led from sixteen to sixty. Scarcely any man has been better entitled
      to be called a thorough man of the world. The founding of a new
      philosophy, the imparting of a new direction to the minds of speculators,
      this was the amusement of his leisure, the work of hours occasionally
      stolen from the Woolsack and the Council Board. This consideration, while
      it increases the admiration with which we regard his intellect, increases
      also our regret that such an intellect should so often have been
      unworthily employed. He well knew the better course, and had, at one time,
      resolved to pursue it. &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; said he in a letter written when he
      was still young, &ldquo;that I have as vast contemplative ends as I have
      moderate civil ends.&rdquo; Had his civil ends continued to be moderate, he
      would have been, not only the Moses, but the Joshua of philosophy. He
      would have fulfilled a large part of his own magnificent predictions. He
      would have led his followers, not only to the verge, but into the heart of
      the promised land. He would not merely have pointed out, but would have
      divided the spoil. Above all, he would have left, not only a great, but a
      spotless name. Mankind would then have been able to esteem their
      illustrious benefactor. We should not then be compelled to regard his
      character with mingled contempt and admiration, with mingled aversion and
      gratitude. We should not then regret that there should be so many proofs
      of the narrowness and selfishness of a heart, the benevolence of which was
      yet large enough to take in all races and all ages. We <span
      class="pagenum">495</span><a name="link495" id="link495"></a>should not
      then have to blush for the disingenuousness of the most devoted worshipper
      of speculative truth, for the servility of the boldest champion of
      intellectual freedom. We should not then have seen the same man at one
      time far in the van, at another time far in the rear of his generation. We
      should not then be forced to own that he who first treated legislation as
      a science was among the last Englishmen who used the rack, that he who
      first summoned philosophers to the great work of interpreting nature, was
      among the last Englishmen who sold justice. And we should conclude our
      survey of a life placidly, honourably, beneficently passed, &ldquo;in
      industrious observations, grounded conclusions, and profitable inventions
      and discoveries,&rdquo; (1) with feelings very different from those with which
      we now turn away from the checkered spectacle of so much glory and so much
      shame.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
